# DESCRIPTION

This command lets git-annex be used as a git filter driver which lets
annexed files in the git repository to be unlocked at all times, instead
of being symlinks.

When adding a file with `git add`, the annex.largefiles config is
consulted to decide if a given file should be added to git as-is,
or if its content are large enough to need to use git-annex.

The git configuration to use this command as a filter driver is normally
set up for you by git-annex init as shown in the SYNOPSIS, 
so you should not need to configure it manually.

To make git use that filter driver, it needs to be configured in
the .gitattributes file or in `.git/config/attributes`. The latter
is normally configured when a repository is initialized, with the following
contents:

	* filter=annex
	.* !filter
