> That also relates to software relying on git-annex, such as datalad, as it somehow needs to know/discover that underlying call to git-annex apparently needs some credentials to be passed via env vars

Since `git-annex initremote` displays an error message when it needs
creds, does datalad not forward that error message to the user?

There seems to be a significant disconnect between what you're describing
