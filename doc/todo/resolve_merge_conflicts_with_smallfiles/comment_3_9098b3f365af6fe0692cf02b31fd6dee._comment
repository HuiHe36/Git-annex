\"Small files\" here means \"non-annexed files\", right?

Whether a file is annexed, and whether its merge conflicts should be auto-resolved by creating two files `file.version-a` and `file.version-b`, seem like orthogonal things.
One might check small binary files directly into git, and one might annex source code files e.g. just for the simplicity of annexing everything (as [[DataLad|projects/datalad]] does or at least used to).

So, maybe, `.gitattributes` should control which files' merge conflicts get auto-resolved?
