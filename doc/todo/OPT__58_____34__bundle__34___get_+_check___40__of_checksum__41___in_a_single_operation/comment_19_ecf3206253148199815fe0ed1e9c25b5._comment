@joey I don't know what you mean by scanning in this case but I now have proof that git-annex really is
doing an extra read pass over the whole file after it's been transferred from one regular remote to the
other in the case of `sync --content[-of _file_]`. I filed a bug with details:
[`sync -C` takes longer to get file than `get`](https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__96__sync_-C__96___takes_longer_to_get_file_than___96__get__96__/)
(btw. I can't seem to be able to make this into a WikiLink as ikiwiki thinks of the underscores of the page name as denoting strong emphasis).
