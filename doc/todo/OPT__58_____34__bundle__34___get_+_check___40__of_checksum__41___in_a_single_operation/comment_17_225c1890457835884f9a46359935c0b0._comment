Hi Joey! Could you think of a reason why a `git annex sync --no-commit --content` takes pretty
much double the time to retrieve an annexed file than a `git annex get .` in the same directory /
git remote with this one file added in origin? Naturally I drop the file inbetween measurements
and my files are of multi-gigabyte size so the delay is really noticeable between two HDDs.
It seems that the extra time (and disk activity) takes place after the retrieval has hit 100% so
to me it feels like git-annex is doing an extra verification pass after copying the file. This is
on Windows and git-annex is a fresh `8.20210804-g492036622` but I seem to have noticed it
happening even before your latest development activities above (as in months ago). Should I
file a bug report about this?
