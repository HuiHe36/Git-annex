I've implemented a tailVerify; all that remains to be done is hook
all special remotes that retrieve to a file up to use it.

That's mostly ones using fileRetriever, which will come down to making
retrieveChunks use it, probably. Although it may be that a few of them,
like Remote.Directory, could avoid using it and feed the verifier
themselves, more efficiently.

There are also a couple of special remotes that don't use fileRetriever or
retrieveChunks but could also use tailVerify. Looks like only Remote.BitTorrent
and Remote.Web. But bittorrent is just the kind of thing that tailVerify
will not support well due to random access. And Remote.Web could feed the
verifier itself.
