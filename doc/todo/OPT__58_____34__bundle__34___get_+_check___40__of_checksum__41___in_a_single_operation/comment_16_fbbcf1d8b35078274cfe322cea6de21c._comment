The concurrency problem is fixed now.

As well as the web special remote, these do not do incremental hashing
still: directory, gitlfs, webdav, S3.

The ones that do are: external, adb, gcrypt, hook, rsync

The issue with directory etc is that they open the file
for write. This prevents tailVerify re-opening it for read, because the
haskell RTS actually does not allowing opening a file for read that it has
open for write.
