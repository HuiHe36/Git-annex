The concurrency problem is fixed now.

As well as the web special remote, these do not do incremental hashing
still: gitlfs, webdav, S3. Problem is, these open the file
for write. This prevents tailVerify re-opening it for read, because the
haskell RTS actually does not allowing opening a file for read that it has
open for write. This problem has already been fixed for directory.

The ones that do are: external, adb, gcrypt, hook, rsync, directory
