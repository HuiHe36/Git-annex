The concurrency problem is fixed now.

All special remotes now do incremental hashing in most cases
(on linux, subset on other OS's).

Only thing remaining is:
Retrieval from export/import special remotes does not do incremental
hashing (except for versioned ones, which sometimes use retrieveKeyFile).
