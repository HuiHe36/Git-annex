The concurrency problem is fixed now.

Directory, webdav, web, and S3 now also do incremental hashing.

These do not do incremental hashing
still: gitlfs, httpalso. Problem is, these open the file
for write. That prevents tailVerify re-opening it for read, because the
haskell RTS actually does not allowing opening a file for read that it has
open for write. The new `fileRetriever\`` can be used instead to fix these,
but will take some more work.

Also, retrieval from export/import special remotes does not do incremental
hashing (except for versioned ones, which sometimes use retrieveKeyFile).
