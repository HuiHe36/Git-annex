The script needed a few tweaks, you can find the updated version [here](https://gist.github.com/Lukey3332/203ea6f30d48323e7bd1d05c16b5da9c).

I used the script here since half a year now and everything works fine. I even had a problem with failed transfers due to a bad SATA-cable and the script did handle it properly. `git annex fsck --all` confirms that everything is alright.
