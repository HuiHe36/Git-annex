I'm not super enthused by this idea. The git-check-attr interface would
make it hard to avoid using one process per use of the option. 
Checking attributes can be slow. Attributes are limited in what 
they can contain. Some places where git-annex uses gitattributes I have
ended up regretting it. A compelling use case would be good.

Might also be possible to support this in preferred content. Although it
looks a bit hard to do, because it would need to start up a git-check-attr
process for each different attribute used, while parsing the preferred content
expression.
