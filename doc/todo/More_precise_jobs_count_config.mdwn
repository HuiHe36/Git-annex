There is `annex.jobs` to configure job count globally but the need for parallelisation varies greatly for me.

For example, sync should do its git commands with as many remotes in parallel as it can to minimise sync runtime but copy, move, fsck etc. on a local slow hard drive should only do one or two files at a time.

Could there be a way to be more precise with how much parallelisation you want by default?

Maybe for each sub-command or resource access pattern.
