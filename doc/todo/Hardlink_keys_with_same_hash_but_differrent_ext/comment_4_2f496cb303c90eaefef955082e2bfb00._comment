@Atemu because the hard link to an unlocked file risks
it being modified, and losing the content of another key
is outside the risk profile allowed by annex.thin.

Also it could be hard linked for other reasons, like
a local clone does, and that also should not be exposed
to modification.

Moving all the object files to the same directory does not
help in the case of git-annex get, where the object files
don't exist yet. It would still need a way to find all the equivilant keys
to populate those.
