Right. It is possible to get this into a sqlite database and update it
incrementally. The keys database is populated this way, but that's by
tracking changes to the HEAD branch. This would instead involve
tracking changes to the git-annex branch.

See [[cache_key_info]] for discussion of this kind of thing.
