Costs are information about the connection from the local repository to a
remote, which is why they are stored only locally in the git config -- I
may have much different cost than you to access the same repository.

When there are multiple urls all claimed by the web remote, that's a
single remote, and the code that looks at costs decides which remote is
lowest cost, and tries that one first. When it gets down to the web remote,
it tries the urls in whatever order it happens to have them.

So, the proposed way to assign costs to urls could only change the order
that urls are presented to the web remote. It would not let git-annex
try to get first from web (cheap url), followed by another repo, followed
by web (expensive url).

What you can do is have a special remote, that claims all the relevent
urls and then does its own ordering of them. Or perhaps different
special remotes that claim different sets of urls, and assign costs to
those remotes. (Using --sameas so the several remotes do not
count as more than 1 copy.)
