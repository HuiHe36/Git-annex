From what I can see, kde-connect lets the phone be used to run specific,
pre-selected commands on the linux computer it's paired with. Not the other
way around. <https://userbase.kde.org/KDE_Connect/Tutorials/Adding_commands>
Also being able to run a command on a phone is rather a long way from what
git-annex actually needs.

It seems like it would be possible to use the remote filesystem via sftp part
of it. <https://rafaelc.org/tech/p/mounting-kde-connect-filesystem-via-cli/>
That would be a useful alternative to adb. I don't think git-annex needs
any changes to use it that way, just mount it with sshfs and
initremote a directory special remote with exporttree=yes and
importtree=yes.

See also [[add_sftp_special_remote]] which if it were implemented would
avoid needing to use sshfs.
