>I do not want to add global config settings for every single git config setting

Of course.  Just the settings that reflect the nature of the repo data and the intended usage processes.
E.g. I want to be able to enforce that a repo be locked-files-only.  Or to set `maxextensionlength` based on the
fact that the repo stores `.fastq.gz` files.

>annex.supportunlocked is documented to be about avoiding extra work needed to support unlocked files, and not about preventing them from being added to a branch

To me it seems more natural to have it prevent the addition of unlocked files, and be a global setting.
