supportunlocked would definitely make sense; it can help protect against users accidentally checking in a file in the wrong mode even though it doesn't fit the repo's workflows.

The alternative to setting this across all repos using git-annex config, at least in my workflows, would be to set a git hook to reject pushes (to master or synced/master) that contain unlocked files, but that sounds way more complex.
