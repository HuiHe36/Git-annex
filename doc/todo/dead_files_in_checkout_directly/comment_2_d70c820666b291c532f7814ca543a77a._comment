In <https://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Forget_about_accidentally_added_file__63__/>
there is an idea of `git annex unannex --forget file`

And using unannex for this makes some sense; it's intended to be used to undo an
accidental `git-annex add`. When it's used that way, and later `git-annex
unused` finds the object file is not used by anything and the object gets
deleted, fsck --all will start complaining about it.

But there are still many ways it could go wrong. Being run recursively by
accident. Or another file, perhaps in another branch, using the same key,
which gets marked as dead.

Hmm, `git annex dropunused` (or `drop --unused`)
could mark the key as dead. At that point it's known to be unused.

This way, the existing workflow of git-annex unannex followed by git-annex
unused followed by dropping can be followed, and fsck --all does
not later complain about the key.

Done!
