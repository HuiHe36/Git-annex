I suppose this could be useful, but note that `git annex fsck` without
--all will still warn if it finds a file in the working tree with no
existing content, even if its key has been marked dead. Because having a
file in the working tree that you can't get is certainly a bad situation.

So, if this feature got implemented, you would want to follow `git annex
dead` of a file with `git rm` of the file. Probably.

The other reason dead only operates on keys is that the expected
workflow was that the user will lose data, will delete the lost file out of
their working tree, or overwrite it or whatever, and then at some later
point get annoyed that fsck --all complains about it, and so then mark it
dead. But if you want to be proactive, marking a file dead is certainly
useful to be able to do.

I'd also be concerned that `git annex dead` or `git annex dead .` run
accidentally could be an annoying mistake to recover from. Certianly
it should not default to marking all files dead when there are no
parameters!
