Sequoia-PGP could be another contender (OpenPGP in rust). There is a sq
command line interface that is equivilant to gpg.

It should be able to decrypt objects in repositories encrypted using gpg.
If that works well, git-annex could support it in parallel with gpg for
some time, then deprecate the gpg support and eventually remove it. This is
a more appealing path than supporting multiple encryption tools
indefinitely.

This issue is a pre-requisite for using sq, although presumably the
low-level library could be used directly to avoid the issue.
