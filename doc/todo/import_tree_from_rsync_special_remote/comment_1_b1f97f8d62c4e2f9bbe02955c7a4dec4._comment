This seems more tractable if a rsync remote supports only importtree=yes
but not also exporttree=yes.

That would prevent needing to worry about git-annex making changes
to the remote at the same time it's getting content from it. Any changes
would be made by something else, and git-annex would only import them.

store/remove would not do anything. checkpresent would perhaps always
fail.
