It could be helpful to have some kind of git config, similar to
remote.name.annex-cost, that categorizes remotes by what amount of
concurrency is desirable when accessing them.

But then the kind of access can also matter, eg git pull from a ssh remote
might as well be run concurrently with all other ssh remote pulls,
but not so when downloading annex objects from ssh remotes.

There is also the problem that what action will be taken on a particular file
is up to the command, but the amount of concurrency to use has to be
determined before running that command on that file. Eg, git-annex get
might use a slow hard drive, or a fast ssd that benefits from
concurrency. We don't know until that code runs, but we have to decide how
many threads to spawn before hand.
