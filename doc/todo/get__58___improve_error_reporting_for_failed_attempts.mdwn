ATM `annex get` (in particular '--json --json-error-messages --json-progress') would channel to the user the error from an attempt to get a key from a remote with a message which lacks information about remote and/or specifics of that particular attempt (e.g. which URL was attempted from web remote), e.g.

```
$> git clone https://github.com/dandisets/000029 && cd 000029

  download failed: Not Found

ok
(recording state in git...)

$> git annex version | head -n 1
git-annex version: 8.20210803+git165-g249d424b8-1~ndall+1
```

NB. That "download failed: Not Found" is also channeled in that form (without any extra information) among "errors" of `--json-error-messages` (and each progress message within `--json-progress`) 

As such the message is not informative really, and might even be a bit confusing to the user since `get` does `ok` eventually here.
I think it is useful to channel such information but it should be extended, e.g. in this case could be

```
  failed to retrieve content from 'web' remote: https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/dandisets/000029/versions/draft/assets/b3675aad-db07-4fd4-9cce-c95f1184e7a3/download/ - Not Found
```

or alike. Even though considerably longer, it immediately provides feedback from which remote it failed to retrieve, and what was that particular URL.
