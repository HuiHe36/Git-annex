The particular batch output format is not specified for this, and it's
rather ad-hoc. I think this is the only --batch that is treated all as a
single action with "registerurl (stdin)" at start and only one "ok" at the
end of all the batched input. That was inherited from the non-batch
behavior. Implementing --batch --json would need a second, redundant
implementation that treats each batch input as its own action. Only using
that for --json would be weird, but using it for --batch generally would be
a behavior change. Urk.

Aside from crashing if an invalid key is provided,
or perhaps some other exceptional error, there are no real ways it could
fail so --json-error-messages is unlikely to be useful.

(unregisterurl has the same interface and mostly same implementation,
and so same problems as registerurl.)
