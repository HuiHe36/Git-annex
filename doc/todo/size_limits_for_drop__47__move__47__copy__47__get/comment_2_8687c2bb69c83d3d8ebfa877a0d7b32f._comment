--size-limit is implemented, for most git-annex commands.

Ones like `git-annex add` that don't operate on annexed files don't support
it, at least yet.

Ones like git-annex export/import/sync I'm not sure it makes sense to
support it, since they kind of operate at a higher level than individual
files.
