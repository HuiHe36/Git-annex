Like was recently done for preferred content, when checking numcopies for a
drop, it could check if other files are using the same key, and if so check
that their numcopies (and mincopies) is satisfied as well.

There would be an efficiency tradeoff of course, since it would have to
query the keys db. The question I suppose is, if someone sets different
numcopies for different files via .gitattributes, and they use the same
key, will the user think it's a problem that numcopies can be violated in
some circumstances. And I think that users would maybe consider that to be
a problem, if they happened to encounter the behavior.

It may also be worth considering making --all (etc) also check numcopies of
associated files. Although then, in a bare repo, it would behave
differently than in a non-bare repo. (Also if this is done, the preferred
content checking should also behave the same way.) The docs for --all 
do say that it bypasses checking .gitattributes numcopies.
