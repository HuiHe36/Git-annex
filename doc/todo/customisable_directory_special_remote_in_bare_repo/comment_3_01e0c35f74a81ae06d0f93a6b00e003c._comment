It would not make sense for a non-bare git repository to have annexed
contents in it encrypted or chunked, because that would prevent actually
accessing the annexed files at all; git-annex symlinks have to point to a
complete, non-encrypted file.

Bare git repositories are a very minor special case of non-bare git
repositories; they do not have a work tree or index. In other
respected, they are the same, and it's entirely possible to manually
convert a git repo to or from bare, or even temporarily use a bare repo
with a work tree.

It would be extremely inelegant if git-annex did something that broke
that. Which this would.

I think you should use a rsync special remote possibly. Which also has the
same layout as a directory special remote.
