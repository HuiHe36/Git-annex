Hello,

By means of bisection I have determined that commit 4bf7940d6b912fbf692b268f621ebd41ed871125, recently uploaded to Debian after the bullseye freeze, is responsible for breaking the annex-to-annex-reinject script which ships with Git::Annex.  Here is a minimal reproducer of the problem:

    spwhitton@melete:~/tmp>echo foo >bar
    spwhitton@melete:~/tmp>mkdir annex
    spwhitton@melete:~/tmp>cp bar annex
    spwhitton@melete:~/tmp>cd annex
    spwhitton@melete:~/tmp/annex>git init
    spwhitton@melete:~/tmp/annex>git annex add bar
    spwhitton@melete:~/tmp/annex>git annex drop --force bar
    spwhitton@melete:~/tmp/annex>git annex reinject --known /home/spwhitton/tmp/bar
