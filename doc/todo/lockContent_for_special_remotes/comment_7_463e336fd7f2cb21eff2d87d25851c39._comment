It certainly must be possible to use a git-annex remote to handle locking
for special remotes, after all if you inverted control and had that
git-annex repository communicating to the user's reposities and telling
them when to delete from the special remote, that would be race safe.

But it seems that the usual git-annex remote operations are not sufficient
to do it. It would need some new operations tailored to support it.
