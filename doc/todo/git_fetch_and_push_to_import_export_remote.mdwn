It should be possible for `git fetch foo` to work when foo is a special
remote with importtree=yes. This would have the same effect as running
`git-annex import --from foo`.

Also `git push foo` when it supports export, would have the same effect as
running `git annex export --to foo`

It would need `remote.foo.url` to be set to something like `annex::foo`
which would make fetch and pull run `git-remote-annex`. Currently, special
remote's don't get an url configured. (`annex::uuid` was my first thought,
but `annex::foo` avoids repeating the remote's uuid and git-annex can
look up the uuid from the name) --[[Joey]]
