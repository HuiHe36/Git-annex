Using location tracking for this seems to trade off the time to contact the
remote and check presence with bloat of the git repository. This does not
strike me as a good tradeoff. If I were going to implement this, I suppose
I'd store the information in sqlite instead.

I'm not clear what the use case or benefit of this would be?
