Ah, making your script smart is reasonable enough.

I hope you might consider sharing the script in a tip?

Looking at your updated patch, you now leave the freezeContent call before it
moves to the object file, and add another call afterwards. I think that would
be objectionable if the user has a freeze hook that is expensive
the run, because it would unncessarily run twice. I fairly well satisfied
myself in comment #1 that it's ok to defer freezeContent to after it's
moved the object file into place.

So, I've applied it, but modified to remove that earlier freezeContent.
