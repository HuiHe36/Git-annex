Sorry I missed explaining a few things and made a mistake in the patch. I made my freeze script detect whether the input is inside or outside of .git/annex/objects, so there are no problems with calling freezeContent on something in the working tree. The problem is not calling freezeContent on the final object, because the delete permission can only be denied at that point. The easiest way without compromising the safety of the previous behaviour is to add another freezeContent call after moveFile.
