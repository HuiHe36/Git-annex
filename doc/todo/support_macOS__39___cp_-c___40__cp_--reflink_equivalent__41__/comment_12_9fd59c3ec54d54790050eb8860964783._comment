Problem is that in our Nix sandbox, `cp` is always coreutils' while on the actual system, it might be macOS'. 

It'd be nice to have a way to declare what binary to use (with absolute path or just binary name) for `cp` and the like, that way we can get rid of our runtime wrapper that puts coreutils in git-annex' PATH in anticipation of features that rely on GNU coreutils.
