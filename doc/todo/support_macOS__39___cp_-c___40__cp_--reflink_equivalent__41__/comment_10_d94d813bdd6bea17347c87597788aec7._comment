GNU coreutils will implement reflink copies on macOS in the next major version, so we will get this for free: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/coreutils.git/commit/?id=5e36c0ce078a65c7dac6ac5ebdfb0cf096856427

I use GNU coreutils system-wide because they're much better but not all users do that. We might need extra logic to handle odd aliases some distros give to GNU coreutils use like `gcp`. Is there a build-time way to specify which coreutils git-annex should use at runtime?
