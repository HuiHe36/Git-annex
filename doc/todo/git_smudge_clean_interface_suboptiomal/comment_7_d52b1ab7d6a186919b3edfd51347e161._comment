If you're dealing with a repository where you never intend to use unlocked files at all, does it work to just disable the smudge filter entirely?

I'm currently running into the speed issues on `git add`, but I don't have any use for unlocked files in this particular use case, so I'd be happy just to turn off that whole step.
