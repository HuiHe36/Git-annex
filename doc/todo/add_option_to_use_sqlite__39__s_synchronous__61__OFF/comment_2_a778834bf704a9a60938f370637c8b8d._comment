>detecting corrupted sqlite databases and rebuilding them. I don't know if it's really possible to detect.

Could you detect whether a git-annex command finished normally,by creating a marker file when it starts, and deleting the marker file as the last thing before exiting?
The next command then checks if the previous one crashed, and rebuilds the dbs if yes (or just warns the user and offers to rebuild.)

Aren't all file hashes recorded in git, which would not be affected by a sqlite crash?
