There's a choice between the hook needing to replicate git-annex's
use of permissions as well as doing whatever else it does, or git-annex
setting the permissions first, and only then running the hook.

Seems to me that git-annex setting the permissions is better, because then
the hook does not need to worry about details like core.sharedrepository
if it's doing something simple like setting immutable. (But if it adjusts
ACLs, it might make sense for it to consider core.sharedrepository.) Also,
the precise details of what file permissions git-annex uses don't need to
be documented well enough for the hook to replicate them if git-annex just
makes the permissions changes itself.

It seems to make sense that when restoring permissions, it should run the
that hook before changing the permissions. The freeze hook might do
something that prevents changing permissions and the thaw hook undo that.
