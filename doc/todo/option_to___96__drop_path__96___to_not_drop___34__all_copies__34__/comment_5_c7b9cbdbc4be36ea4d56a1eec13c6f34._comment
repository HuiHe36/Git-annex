On the --includeifany=glob idea, that seems to suggest a preferred content
expression like includeifany=, analagous to how --include matches include=

I'm feeling a bit cautious about adding a preferred content expression for
this brand new capability. 

And also unfortunately, it turned out not to be possible to prevent the
associated files db from sometimes having stale filenames in it (see
[[!commit c1b50282118520350d5328153fceedac2b8d8ed5]]). Which all current
uses of the associated files db deal with by checking the list of
associated files to see if all of them are in HEAD tree. A preferred
content expression would also have to deal with that, and that risks
slowing down evaluation of preferred content expressions generally.

So I think it's best to not add a preferred content expression,
at least until there's a use case and this has had
some time to soak.
