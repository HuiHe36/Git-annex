What happens if I run `git annex drop --not-used-elsewhere foo bar` and foo
and bar have the same content?

The content is not used except for in the files I listed, so it could be
argued that the --not-used-elsewhere does not apply, and it should drop it.
But of course, that becomes a problem when dropping large directory trees.

This also makes me thing that not-used-elsewhere is too broad, maybe I want
to only avoid dropping content shared by files in bardir while dropping
foodir, and the option does not allow it.

So I do think @Ilya's on to something with his suggestion.
`git annex drop foo --excludeifany=bar` does not have the ambiguity.

I guess it's also useful for querying, potentially. Eg, if I have an inbox
and an outbox and think perhaps some things from the inbox are things I've
already dealt with before, I can find such files:

	git annex find inbox --includeifany='outbox/*'
