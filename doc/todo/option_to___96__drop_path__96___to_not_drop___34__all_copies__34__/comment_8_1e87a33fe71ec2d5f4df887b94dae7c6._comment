Thinking about preferred content expression some more, there should not
be much reason to use this in one. includesamecontent=foo would have the
same effect as include=foo, because when it operates on bar, it already
checks if foo is the same content and is preferred content, and if so
avoids dropping it. And when getting files, the effect would also be the
same, because include=foo makes it get foo, same as includesamecontent=foo
would.
