You can use: `git-annex info . --in here`

But, it should be possible when getting info for all keys
to use the matching options like --in that do not match on a filename.
It used to be that there was no way to tell which kind of matching options 
where used, but now `matchNeedsFileName` is available and it could only
reject those.

So this can be implemented by making cachedPresentData
and cachedRemoteData get the matcher, check if it's
the right kind and apply it to the keys.
