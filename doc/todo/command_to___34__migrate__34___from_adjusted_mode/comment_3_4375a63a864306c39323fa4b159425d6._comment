Ok, so the object location usually used in bare repositories.. 

One way that could happen is if core.symlinks=false and
annex.crippledfilesystem=true. Then it does use the bare form of object
filenames, which is kind of ok since it's not going to be using symlinks in
that repository.

Also, before 2016
([[commit 2d00523609def535588b693a00d4092768e1c3c6]]), 
git-annex used those names whenever annex.crippledfilesystem=true,
no matter what core.symlinks was set to. So if the files are that old..

This does seem to point to there needing to be a way to migrate the object
files in a repository to the right names. It might be a reasonable thing
for git-annex fsck to do, when it sees a symlink to an object file that
is in the other location.
