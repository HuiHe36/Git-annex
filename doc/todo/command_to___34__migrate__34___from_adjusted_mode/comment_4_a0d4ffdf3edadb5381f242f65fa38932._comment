The rationalle for using the bare object layout when on a crippled
filesystem was given in [[!commit f1b0a4b404ed835f1c4a27a92352180be8564f8a]].
Basically it may be more portable. Not a strong rationalle at all, as the
later change to not do it when symlinks are supported shows. But
I don't think worth changing at this point.

So teaching fsck to move object files to the preferred location seems the
best way. It will also deal with the situation where a bare repository gets
converted by the user into a non-bare repo.
