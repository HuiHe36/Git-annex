Just one addition to my previous comment: I agree with the notion, that this is under no circumstances a security or a kindergarten feature.  So if someone intentionally overrides it, then of course, that's the fact of life, and I have to handle those team members in other social ways, not via technological overengineering.  So if the final proposal provides a way to protect against accidental git clones and accidental special remotes both, then I'm good.  It only has to protect against accidents, not against malice.
