It seems to me that making annex.private a global
configuration that can be set with `git-annex config` and overridden
locally with .git/config on the repository you want to record
to the git-annex branch would have the same effects.

While a user could override it in their clone with .git/config, 
they could also use a version of git-annex that ignores your
uuid-allowlist.log.

Also, uuid-allowlist.log would imply that merging two git-annex
branches could fail, if one of them referred to uuids that are not
allowed in another one. Since git-annex does such merges in the backend,
that would mean that git-annex could just start failing without any
apparent reason why or anything for the user to do to fix it. I would
not want to support the bug reports that would result from that.
