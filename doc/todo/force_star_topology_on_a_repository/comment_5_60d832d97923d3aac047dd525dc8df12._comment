What happens if someone sets this git-annex config, but the repo is also
used by someone else, who does not want to honor that, and wants to have
their own group of git-annex repos that work together as usual? 

This is a reasonable difference of opinion to have, and this kind of
disagreement needs to be considered when adding a `git-annex config`
setting.

Usually, `git-annex config` settings can be overridden by
`git config`. So there would need to be a annex.privateexcept
git config as well.
