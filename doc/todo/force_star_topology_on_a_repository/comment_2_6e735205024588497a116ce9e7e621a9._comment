Thank you for reading and replying to my feature request.

I agree with most of what you have said, and I agree that making `annex.private` `git-annex config`urable is 99% of my feature request.

I wrote the rest of the text, because I actually had a case, while testing this star topology thing where an uuid crept into the git-annex branch and it was coming from testing a special remote with rclone and not being careful enough with it.  So, I think the global `annex.private` variable somehow also has to support special remotes and then there has to be a way to opt-out the one special remote, that is the real center of the star topology.
