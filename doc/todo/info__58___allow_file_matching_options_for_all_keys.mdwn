I want to see aggregate stats on all keys known to git-annex while using matching options like `--in here`, `--copies` etc.

The obvious thing I tried was to use `git annex info --in here` but that complains:

```
git-annex: File matching options can only be used when getting info on a directory.
```

There should be a way to use `info` to query aggregate information properties of all keys instead of directories.

I have used `git annex info .` in the repos I used up until now because every key was in the tree. Though I also have a feeling that operating on all keys could be significantly faster than filtering them to match some directory.
