This got slower again since it now also has to scan locked files as well as
unlocked. And so disabling smudge filters doesn't avoid it either.

It should be possible to speed this up by streaming the ls-tree through
cat-file, like is done in CmdLine.Seek (catObjectStreamLsTree). Speedup
probably in the order of 2-3x.
