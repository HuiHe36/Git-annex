The lengthy scan would only happen once -- when the worktree is first checked out -- and would be incremental from then on, right?
But it would slow things down every time a new checkout of a large repo happens?  Maybe the scan could be done lazily, invoked when the results are first needed?
Also, if you just need to know which keys are used more than once, maybe a Bloom filter of the keys used in the worktree would suffice, instead of a full keys-to-paths SQL db?
