Implemented streaming through git. In a repo with 100000 unlocked files,
version 8.20210429 took 46 seconds, now reduced to 36 seconds.

When the files are locked, of course the old version was faster
due to being able to skip all symlinks, 2 seconds. The new version takes
slightly less time than it does for unlocked files, 35 seconds.

Now the git query and processing is only a few seconds of the total run time,
writing information about all the files to sqlite is most of the rest,
and may also be possible to speed up.
