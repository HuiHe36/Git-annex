Turns out git-annex init was running both scanAnnexedFiles and
reconcileStaged, which after recent changes to the latter, both do
close to the same scan when run in a fresh clone. So double work!

Benchmarking with 100,000 files, git-annex init took 88 seconds.  
Fixed not to use reconcileStaged it took 37 seconds.

(Keeping reconcileStaged and removing scanAnnexedFiles it took 47 seconds.
That makes sense; reconcileStaged is an incremental updater and is not
able to use SQL as efficiently as scanAnnexedFiles.)

---

Also the git clone of that 100,000 file repo itself, from another repo on
the same SSD, takes 9 seconds. git-annex init taking 4x as long as
a fast local git clone to do a scan is not bad.

This is EOT for me, but I will accept pathes if someone wants to make
git-annex faster.
