If your filesystem supports reflinks, you should not need to enable
annex.thin, just let git-annex make copies. It makes the copy
using `cp --reflink=auto`, so when reflinks are supported, you'll get a
nice cheap reflink.

WRT annex.thinmode=forcehardlink, this would be something that aimed the
gun right at the user's foot and then waits for the trigger to be pulled
by any program that ever might write to a file.
