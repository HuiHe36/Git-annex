remote.name.annex-sync controls #2

I don't think it makes sense for different git-annex commands that do
substantially the same thing to have different options to control that
thing. So I do not see why annex.autocommit should not be used by both the
assistant and git-annex sync. If you need to run one command with the
option set and another with the option unset, there are ways to do that, eg
a shell script or git alias.
