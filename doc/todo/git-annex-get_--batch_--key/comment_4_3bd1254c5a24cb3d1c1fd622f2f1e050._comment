The program at [[forum/Migrate_mark_files_dead]] shows again how batch-key would be useful, here for `git annex drop --from remote` and `git annex dead`.

I don't have numbers as I can't run it in batch, but comparing to other multi-file batch drop operations, I guesstimate this makes the difference of a script running for an hour invoking git-annex-drop a thousand times (with interruptions if the SSH agent decides to ask confirmation for a key again) or five minutes with --batch-key.

Like with the original use case of annex-to-web, filtering is not an issue for this application.
