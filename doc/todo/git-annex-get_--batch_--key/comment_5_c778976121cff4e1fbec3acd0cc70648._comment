I've implemented --batch-keys for the commands: get, drop, move, copy, whereis

That covers everything mentioned here except for dead, but that does not
support --batch yet, so if batch mode is needed for it, it can just use
--batch, not --batch-keys. However, after a recent change that makes
dropping unused keys automatically mark them dead, I suspect there
will not be a use case for that.

Most of the other commands that use --batch don't make sense to support
--batch-keys. Eg, add and find can't operate on keys, while 
fromkey already operates on keys. About the only one that might is 
rmurl, but it uses a custom batch format so would not be able to use the
current --batch-keys implementation. If someone needs that or some other
one, they can open a new todo.
