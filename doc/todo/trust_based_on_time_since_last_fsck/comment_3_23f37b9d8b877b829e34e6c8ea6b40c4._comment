Tried to implement this, but ran into a problem adding FsckAll:
If it only logs FsckAll and not also Fsck, then old git-annex expire
will see the FsckAll and not understand it, and treats it as no activity,
so expires. (I did fix git-annex now so an unknown activity is not treated
as no activity.)

And, the way recordActivity is implemented, it
removes previous activities, and adds the current activity. So a FsckAll
followed by a Fsck would remove the FsckAll activity.

That could be fixed, and both be logged, but old git-annex would probably
not be able to parse the result. And if old git-annex is then used to do a
fsck, it would log Fsck and remove the previously added FsckAll.

So, it seems this will need to use some log other than activity.log
to keep track of fsck --all.
