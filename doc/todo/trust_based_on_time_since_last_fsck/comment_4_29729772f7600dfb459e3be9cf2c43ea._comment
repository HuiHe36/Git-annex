Maybe it's better to not tie this directly in to fsck. Another way
would be:

	git annex untrust foo --after=100days

The first time this is run, it would record that the trust level will
change to untrust after 100 days. The next time it's run, it would advance
the timeout.

So, you could do whatever fsck or other checks make you still trust the
repo, and then run this again.

Implementation would I guess need a separate future-trust.log in addition
to trust.log, and when loading trust levels, if there was a value in
future-trust.log that has a newer timestamp than the value in trust.log,
and enough time has passed, use it instead of the value from trust.log.
That way it avoids breaking older git-annex with changes to trust.log.

No need to change what's in trust.log, although it could, which would also
let older git-annex versions learn about the change to trust.
