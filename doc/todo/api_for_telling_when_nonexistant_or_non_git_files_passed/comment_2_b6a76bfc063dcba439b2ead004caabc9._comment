But datalad is apparently concerning itself with just that, since
there was a bug when git-annex's "not found" stderr changed.

I do think this needs to have a good motivation before it's implemented,
and that's currently all I have, that datalad for some reason cares about
it. Maybe there is not a good reason for datalad to care though..

You may well be right about adding new JSON objects breaking parsers.
