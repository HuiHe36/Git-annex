It'd be very useful if you could specify a size limit for drop/move/copy/get-type operations. `git annex move --to other --limit 1G` would move at most 1G of data to the other repo for example.

This way you could quickly "garbage collect" a few dozen GiB from your annex repo when you're running out of space without dropping everything for example.

Another issue this could be used to mitigates is that, for some reason, git-annex doesn't auto-stop the transfer when the repos on my external drives are full properly.

I imagine there are many more use-cases where quickly being able to set a limit for the amount of data a command should act on could come in handy.
