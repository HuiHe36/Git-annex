I think you would be better off using `git-annex whereis` in 
this kind of situation.

--unique-repos would be a fix specific to your own situation of having
multiple names for a repo, but it would not help a user who had similar
difficulty reading the output just because they have a lot of different
repos. 

The output of `git-annex whereis` is better suited to scaling to a lot of
repos.
