I tried making reconcileStaged display the message itself, this is the
result:

	add foo
	100%  30 B             73 KiB/s 0s(scanning for annexed files...)
	ok

So for that to be done, showSideAction would need to clear the progress
bar display first. Note that the display is ok when concurrent output is
enabled:

	add c (scanning for annexed files...)
	ok

Ok.. Fixed that display glitch, and made reconcileStaged display
the message itself when it's taking a while to run.
