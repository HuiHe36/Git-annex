Normally the common options are not included in every command's man page
because there are over 100 lines of them. However, I do think it's worth
including --quiet on fsck's man page in this specific case and am doing
that.

Maybe individual command man pages should mention that there are
also a bunch of common options. Perhaps those should be split out of the
git-annex man page, like the git-annex-matching-options man page is
handled.
