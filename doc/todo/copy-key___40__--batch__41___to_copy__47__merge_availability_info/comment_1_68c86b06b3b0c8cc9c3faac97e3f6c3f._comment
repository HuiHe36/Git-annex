If I understand correctly, this might be as straightforard as extracting
the various per-key logs from the git-annex branch, and shoving them into a
new git tree, which the user can then do whatever with. Something like:

	git-annex copy-key path/
	8e1c53342eb6461eedf13ee7d15038b400c70269

The obvious thing for the user to do with such a tree would be 
to git push it to the other repo with a name ending in /git-annex,
which git-annex there will then auto-merge into that repo's git-annex
branch.

When you start talking about hidden repos though, things get more complex,
because exporting key logs from a hidden repo would necessarily expose the
uuid of that repo, and maybe other logged information that was only
stored in the hidden repo as well. If it has to filter it to only the parts
of logs that are used by non-hidden repos, that would be a lot more complex.

It also seems to me that, if you're splitting a repo, you would also want
to include things like trust.log and remote.log, or at least parts of them
for some remotes?
