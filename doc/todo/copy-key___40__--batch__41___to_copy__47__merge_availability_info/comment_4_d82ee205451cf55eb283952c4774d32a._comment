The other axis is, I guess, should it include past commits to the git-annex
branch, or only the current data? I'm inclined toward only the current
data. The only thing that uses past data really is `git-annex log` and it's just
not worth the added time expense. And also `git annex forget` already
throws away the past data.

There is the added wart of exported treeishes being grafted into the
git-annex branch (to avoid them being lost in GC in some edge cases).
It would need to do like `git annex forget` was recently fixed to, and
include those grafts when throwing away the rest of the history.
