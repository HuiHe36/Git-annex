Hmm, it seems possible that two repos could use the same uuid for a
remote, but have different configurations for it. Eg, an internal use repo
that might even embed creds for the remote, and a public use repo that
relies on public http urls to download from the remote.

So there would then be 3 things that need to be able to be specified:

* keys to copy
* uuids whose per-key information should be copied (or ones to skip)
* uuids whose non-per-key information should be copied (or ones to skip)
  (remote description, special remote config, trust, group, preferred
  content, etc)

Might as well add, for completeness:

* whether to copy global config settings, or not (numcopies, mincopies,
  git-annex-config, group-preferred-content, difference.log)

Could get more granular than this, eg only copying some metadata fields and
not others, or description but not trust log, but I'd want to see a use
case. A line has to be drawn somewhere or it just gets ridiculous, and the
user might as well pull up [[internals]] and git-filter-branch and
post-process the tree generated by this command.

So a UI for these 3 or 4 things..

	git-annex copy-branch --keys-from=path 
		--include-key-information-for=repo
		--exclude-key-information-for=repo
		--include-config-for=repo
		--exclude-config-for=repo
		--include-global-config
		--exclude-global-config

Eg: 

	git-annex copy-branch --keys-from=.
		--exclude-key-information-for=privateremote
		--exclude-config-for=privateremote
		--include-global-config
