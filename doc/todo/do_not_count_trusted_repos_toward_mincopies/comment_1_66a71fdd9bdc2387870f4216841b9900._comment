Perhaps there could be a way to manually \"lock\" a remote into append-only permanently such that all repos perceive it as locked and therefore trust it to keep its content.

Obviously this isn't as good of a trust as having it connected directly and actively locking it at runtime but it's the best you could do for cold storage. (Btw, does git-annex check whether the content to be dropped is actually present in the repos it locked?)

The append-only repo would only be allowed to unlock itself and drop content again when all other (unlocked?) repos ack'd the unlock (or via `--force`).
