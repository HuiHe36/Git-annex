Actually, fsck never warns about upgrading MD5 to any SHA hash.
The message you are seeing is about upgrading something already using
SHA256E to an improved version. The `--backend=SHA256E` displayed by
git-annex fsck comes from the backend it sees the file is already using.

The most likely reason a SHA256E file would need migration would be if it
has non-alphanumeric characters in its extension. There are some other
historical problems that it migrates to solve as well. A `git diff` of the
changes that `git annex migrate` made would tell what it did the migration for.

I don't know why fsck then wants to migrate it again. It only looks at the
file staged in git. When I stage that same symlink here, it does not want
to migrate it.

Since your git-annex version is over a year out of date, upgrading to the
current version and checking if it still has the problem is the first step.

(You also seem to have some unusual configuration of your repository, eg
annex.tune.objecthash1=true and annex.tune.objecthashlower=true ... 
is that right?)
