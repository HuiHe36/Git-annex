I've finished up parallelizing git-annex test.

Splitting up the test groups further and improved scheduling sped it up more.
On my laptop, it's dropped from 444 to 334 to now 289 seconds.

Also, the `-J` option is now supported by git-annex test, so you can experiment
to find the number of jobs where it runs fastest in your particular situation.
The default is one job per CPU core.

My guess is that on NFS, it's not CPU bound but is network latency bound,
and so a rather high -J value like -J10 may behave better.
