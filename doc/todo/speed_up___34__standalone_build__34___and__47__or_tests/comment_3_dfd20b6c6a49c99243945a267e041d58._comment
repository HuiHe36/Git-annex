I have ran tests with \"bleeding edge\" build of `git-annex` on ndoli (less busy node) of discovery and unfortunately it is still quite slow -- took 50 minutes

```shell

OK (71.94s)

so there is probably more to the story (NFS), or probably  needing nfs4_*etfacl?  well -- I ran under a folder which should be proper POSIX -- took  5075.48s (the same 10.20220222+git62-gce523f756-1~ndall+1)
