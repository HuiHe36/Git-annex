I have fixed the problem I identified, which was due to git-annex test adding
the cwd to PATH, which caused it to run git-annex.linux/git, so runshell
was being run repeatedly and unncessarily.

Now it will run git-annex.linux/bin/git and avoid the repeated runshell
overhead, so will be about as fast as git-annex not run from the standalone
tarball.
