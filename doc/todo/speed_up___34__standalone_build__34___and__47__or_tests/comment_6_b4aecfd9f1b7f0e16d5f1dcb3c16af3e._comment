@yoh It would be interesting if you could check the speed on NFS when bypassing
the standalone build's overhead by running
`git-annex.linux/shimmed/git-annex/git-annex test`

That will not use the bundled libraries and programs, but if the test
system is reasonably similar to the build system it would still work.

It's good you're testing the standalone build works, but I think this
test is about testing NFS really, so you could leave the standalone build
testing to other test runs than this one, if that is a significant speedup.
