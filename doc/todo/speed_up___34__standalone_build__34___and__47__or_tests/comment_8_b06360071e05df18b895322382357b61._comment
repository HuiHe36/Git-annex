I have implemented parallelism as described in comment 7. 

Currently there are 5 child processes, and the test runtime
dropped from 444 to 334 seconds on my laptop.
Splitting up the test groups further, so there are more child
processes will probably improve that more.
Remains to be seen if it helps on NFS much..

The `git-annex test` output is currently a mess, it needs to be serialized.
Ran out of time to do that today, but the speed improvement is worth
temporarily ugly output.
