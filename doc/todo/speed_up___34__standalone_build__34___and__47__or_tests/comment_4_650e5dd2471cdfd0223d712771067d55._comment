One thing I notice is that the test suite reports
it took 44 minutes (2670 seconds), but time reports
49 minutes. Those additional 5 minutes must be the test
suite cleaning up the test directories. Which fits with NFS.
That is 5 minutes to effectively `rm -rf` maybe 20k directories/files.

Also, you originally said it took more than 1 hour (or perhaps more
than 5000 seconds, which would be 1.4 hours). So it seems that my fix did 
have a significant impact on speed. 

What I see benchmarking locally is that the standalone tarball takes 1016 
seconds (down from 3600+), while a bare git-annex binary takes 614 seconds.
That is probably due to the small overhead (100 failed opens) discussed in
[[this_old_todo|todo/may_be___40__again__41___to_prelink_or_somehow_avoid_all_the_failing_opens__63__]],
multiplied by the thousands of times the test suite runs git-annex.

Parallelizing the test suite seems like the only way to get a substantial
speedup.
