Since you mentioned standalone builds, I suspect you are running
something like: "cd git-annex.linux; ./git-annex test"

I have verified that is much much slower than running git-annex not
from the standalone build. On the order of 1+ hours vs 5 minutes.

There is a simple workaround, run "git-annex.linux/git-annex"
from somewhere outside the standalone build. That will make it much faster.
Here it takes about 5 minutes.

With that said, there's still a lot of room to speed up git-annex
test, and the main thing would probably be to parallelize its tests.
Which can be done, but needs tasty-1.2. That finally made it into debian
stable, so it should be able to depend on it now. I would not be surprised
if it can be sped up 10x that way, because tests often have to wait one or
more seconds after writing a file due to time stamp issues etc.
I have created a `paralleltest` branch with a start on that, not yet working.
