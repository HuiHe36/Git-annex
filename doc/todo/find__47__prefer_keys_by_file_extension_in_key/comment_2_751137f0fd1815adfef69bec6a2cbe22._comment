>It would be perfectly possible for include= to match on filenames in the current branch when used with --all etc

I think the ability of `--all` to operate on all files regardless of branch is important.  I often have many branches, and have files on the current branch that I've overwritten but may want to revert.  It's useful to e.g. copy the content of all `*.bam` files ever created to a given S3 remote, or to generate a report of how much total space is used by content with different extensions.

>Keys with extensions are really a hack to work around the limitations of certain programs

Which still have them ;)  Worse, it's hard to know which do.  So please don't deprecate.   But also, even if started as a hack, letting keys encode metadata like file type -- and then efficiently matching on it -- is separately useful.
