Download speed is displayed in bytes/second, but in some situations, it
would be better to use bits/second, eg Mbps and Kbps rather than MiB/s and
KiB/s.

I noticed this now that I have an internet connection that is
capable of 150-200 Mbps, but varies widely (satellite). While I could think
of that as 19-25 MiB/s those are less round numbers and harder to remember
and match up with the other bandwidth displays.

This might make sense as a per-remote configurable value. Allowing
using MiB/s for a hard drive and Mbps for a network remote. --[[Joey]]
