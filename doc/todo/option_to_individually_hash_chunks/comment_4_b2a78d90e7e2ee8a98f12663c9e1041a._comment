Dropping does present a problem though -- If a single chunk is used by
multiple keys, then dropping one key would drop the chunk and make the
other key no longer be stored on the remote. So it would somehow need to
check if the chunk is used by other keys still stored on the remote,
and the chunk logs don't let that be done efficiently.
