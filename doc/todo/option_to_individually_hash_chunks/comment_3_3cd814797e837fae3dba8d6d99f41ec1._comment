Hashing fixed sized chunks does not get very far toward
deduplication, it really needs a rolling hash.

The chunk design was designed to support this kind of thing from the
beginning, see [[design/assistant/chunks]]. Each chunk has its own Key, and
the chunk log only needs to somehow store data to get from an object's Key
to a list of chunk Keys. Which is currently just a chunk size and number of
chunks, but could be a list of Keys, or a pointer to where to find the
list.

So it's doable, but I have never quite found the tuits to attempt it.
