Is there any chance of getting ssh connection caching supported on Windows?

I didn’t realize the full impact of this until I started syncing a larger repo, but now I understand if you start a sync you have to hand around and be ready with a passphrase when asked, because the sync will pause multiple times waiting for that input.  For testing that’s fine but in production that’s too inconvenient.
