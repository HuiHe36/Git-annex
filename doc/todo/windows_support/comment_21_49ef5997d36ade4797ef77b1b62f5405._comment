User asakurareiko added some instructions to this page how to use git-annex in Ubuntu 20 (presumably
20.04) in WSL1 and I tested them out in my older Ubuntu 18.04 installation and found out that they
amazingly work although my Windows apps couldn't access any of the files that were still locked.
Somehow the symlinks were only in a form that only WSL1 and Cygwin/MSYS2/Git Bash could access
(mind you I have developer mode active and my Windows 10 is also version 21H1 so the environment
was otherwise similar). An interesting use case nonetheless. I edited the section with my corrections
 -- I hope asakurareiko doesn't mind. :)
