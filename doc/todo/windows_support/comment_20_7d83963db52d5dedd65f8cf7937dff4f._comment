Enabling the ssh agent avoids password prompts, but not the latency
of making a ssh connection per transfer.

You can try setting the environment variable `GIT_ANNEX_SSH_SOCKET_DIR`
to point to a directory where ssh can try to put its socket. I don't know
if ssh on windows is able to use a socket or not. It might just work.
