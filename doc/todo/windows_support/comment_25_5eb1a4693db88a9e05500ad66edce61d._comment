That's useful info. :) Many thanks for your input regarding WSL1 use! For me that opens up new avenues by way of
borg special remotes (borg support on Windows is very lacking and there are no recent binaries for it).
I still think git -- and to a lesser extent git-annex -- is performant enough on native Windows, so I'm
going to continue using it that way for those repos that need to be foolproof and in a supported configuration.
But for more experimental uses WSL1 still holds quite some promise wrt git-annex. DrvFs is still many times faster
than 9p of WSL2 *for Windows native files on NTFS* which is an important use case for exchanging data between
Windows and POSIXland. In fact while WSL2 boots incredibly fast for a Hyper-V virtual machine, in many file-level
use cases it can't hold candle to the almost seamless nature of WSL1. The latter has its warts in API compatibility
but in my mind it's quite a undervalued little performer. I hope Microsoft doesn't remove it too soon in favor of WSL2.
