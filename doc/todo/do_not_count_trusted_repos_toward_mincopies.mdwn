Currently, setting a repo to trusted can result in data loss if content
gets removed from that repo. For this reason, --trust has been disabled,
and `git-annex trust` needs --force.

My idea for a better way to handle this is to make trusted repos that
cannot be checked not count toward satisfying mincopies. So while trusting
a repository would let numcopies be violated still, it would avoid data
loss. That would be enough to bring back --trust and not need --force.

Aside from preventing data loss in some situations, the impact of this
behavior change would be that dropping content would fail in some
situations where it used to work. Specifically, when a trusted repo
contains content, but is not accessible, and no other accessible repo
contains the content. That has been a valid use of trusted repos, but it's
also obviously an unsafe one -- if that trusted repo has dropped the
content in the meantime, it risks data loss.

So, is it worth breaking an existing, but unsafe use case, in order to make
it easier to use trust safely?
