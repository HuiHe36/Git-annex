I went back and looked at why this config was added in the first place, and
it seemed to be partly to support extensions of length 5, but also partly
someone wanted to configure it to something large, so the entire filename
(or a lot of it) was treated as an "extension" and appeared in a key!

It should probably be hard capped to something sensible. Setting something
wacky like that locally is shooting your own foot, but once it becomes a global
setting, you can make other users shoot their feet.

I can see how, if a repo's domain includes files that have a longer than
usual extension, it would be useful to set this globally. But I also
have to push back against adding global configs, because the general
trend is toward users requesting a global config for *everything*, which
is not where I want git-anenx to end up. global configs can be an *imposition*
on other users of the repository, and also risk slowing git-annex down.
