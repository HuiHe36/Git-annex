Thanks for reminding me about that option. I shall use the .gitattributes trick to shorten
my init-git-annex.cmd script. :)

As long as that sensible setting is >= 8 as that is a lower bound is what I use. I tend to think
that at most two extension components is what you usually need for identifying a file's \"type\" (think \".tar.gz\").
As for the length of a component, Windows (and probably other modern desktop environments) produces
for instance such extensions as \".search-ms\" (9 characters excluding the dot) for saved Explorer searches.
I don't think that's an unreasonably long extension component for this use case. For more standard file types
to be exchanged via public methods maybe at most five characters per component should be the maximum. However,
git-annex should be lenient towards what it accepts as long as that is reasonably possible to uphold. IMHO, a practical
upper limit for annex.maxextensionlength could be 16 to 20 characters.
