I wholeheartedly agree that this could be useful. On that note I (meekly) query why not put `annex.backend`
also in the set of configs stored in the git-annex branch? Personally I have a script/command file called
`_scripts/init-git-annex.cmd` checked into the repo so that after cloning I can easily `git config` any settings
I need and also `git annex init` the clone by running said script. In OOP terminology it works as a kind
of constructor, if you will. :)
