It's already possible to configure the backend via .gitattributes;
that is strictly better than a `git-annex config` setting for it would be:
It allows selecting different backends in for different types of files, and
even in different branches.

Anyway, this todo can only be about one thing, and that's
maxextensionlength, not backends or whatever other suggestions might have
later be added to it.
