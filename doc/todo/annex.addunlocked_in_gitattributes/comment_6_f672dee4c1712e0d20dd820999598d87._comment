ATM we rely on .gitattributes to set default (to DataLad datasets) backend to be MD5E, so every dataset then is guaranteed to have `.gitattributes`. We also rely in many configurations on setting `largefiles` for different extensions within `.gitattributes`.  I think this is two primary target use cases.  You say that having `.gitattributes` slows down `git` (and `git-annex`) operations -- so would you recommend to switch to specifying those (backend, largefiles) via `git annex config` instead?  

In [datalad/issues/5383 (Stop using .gitattributes for annex.largefiles config )](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5383)  note was that default backend cannot be specified via `git-annex config` -- is that still the case?
