Well, the init scanning is quite optimised by now, and since it will find no
annexed objects, there are no database writes needed, which are the slower
part of that.

You will pay the price though when you later check out the master
branch, since it then has to scan the delta. And that scanning is less
optimised. It would be more beneficial to speed up that scanning
(reconcileStaged), which should be doable by using the git cat-key --batch
trick.

I think the effect is somewhat psychological; if it says it's doing
a scan then people are going to feel on guard that it's expensive. I know that
sometimes git avoids displaying certain progress messages unless it's
determined the operation is going to take a long time (eg git status will
show a progress display in some circumstances but not commonly). That could
be useful here, and probably in other parts of git-annex.
