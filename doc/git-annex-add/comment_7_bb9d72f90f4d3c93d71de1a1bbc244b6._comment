@lh I don't feel this man page's comment section is the place to discuss
this in detail. But suffice to say that even if add behaved the way you
suggest, any other git-annex command can commit the accumulated changes
to the git-annex branch at any time. So the change would not guarantee
the behavior you hope for.

But, you can set annex.alwayscommit to false and run `git-annex merge`
when you do want to commit changes to the git-annex branch.
