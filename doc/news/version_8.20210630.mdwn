git-annex 8.20210630 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Fixed bug that interrupting git-annex repair (or assistant) while
    it was fixing repository corruption would lose objects that were
    contained in pack files. Also the assistant might sometimes have
    crashed with the same result.
  * repair: Fix reversion in version 8.20200522 that prevented fetching
    missing objects from remotes.
  * sync: Partly work around github behavior that first branch to be pushed
    to a new repository is assumed to be the head branch, by not pushing
    synced/git-annex first.
  * Added annex.freezecontent-command and annex.thawcontent-command
    configs.
  * Improve display of errors when transfers fail.
  * Dropping an unused object with drop --unused or dropunused will
    mark it as dead, preventing fsck --all from complaining about it
    after it's been dropped from all repositories.
  * addurl, importfeed: Added --no-raw option that forces download
    with youtube-dl or a special remote. In particular this can avoid
    falling back to raw download when youtube-dl is blocked for some
    reason."""]]
