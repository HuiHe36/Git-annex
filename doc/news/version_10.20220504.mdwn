git-annex 10.20220504 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Ignore annex.numcopies set to 0 in gitattributes or git config,
    or by git-annex numcopies or by --numcopies, since that
    configuration would make git-annex easily lose data.
    Same for mincopies.
  * assistant: When annex.autocommit is set, notice commits that
    the user makes manually, and push them out to remotes promptly.
  * multicast: Support uftp 5.0 by switching from aes256-cbc to
    aes256-gcm.
  * Fix test failure on NFS when cleaning up gpg temp directory.
  * Fix a build failure with ghc 9.2.2.
    Thanks, gnezdo for the patch.
  * rsync 3.2.4 broke backwards-compatability by preventing exposing
    filenames to the shell. Made the rsync and gcrypt special remotes
    detect this and disable shellescape. Closes: #[1010397](http://bugs.debian.org/1010397)
  * repair: Avoid treating refs/annex/last-index or other refs that
    are not commit objects as evidence of repository corruption."""]]
