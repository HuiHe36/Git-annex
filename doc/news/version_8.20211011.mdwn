git-annex 8.20211011 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""  * Added annex.bwlimit and remote.name.annex-bwlimit config to limit
    the bandwidth of transfers. It works for git remotes and many
    but not all special remotes.
  * Bug fix: Git configs such as annex.verify were incorrectly overriding
    per-remote git configs such as remote.name.annex-verify.
    (Reversion in version 4.20130323)
  * borg: Significantly improved memory use when a borg repository
    contains many archives.
  * borg: Avoid trying to extract xattrs, ACLS, and bsdflags when
    retrieving from a borg repository.
  * Sped up git-annex smudge --clean by 25%.
  * Resume where it left off when copying a file to/from a local git remote
    was interrupted.
  * sync --content: Avoid a redundant checksum of a file that was
    incrementally verified, when used on NTFS and perhaps other filesystems.
  * reinject: Fix crash when reinjecting a file from outside the repository.
    (Reversion in version 8.20210621)
