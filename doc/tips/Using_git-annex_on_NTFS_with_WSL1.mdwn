The following steps are tested on Windows 10 21h1 and are designed to avoid these two bugs:

* [[bugs/WSL_adjusted_braches__58___smudge_fails_with_sqlite_thread_crashed_-_locking_protocol]]
* [[bugs/WSL1__58___git-annex-add_fails_in_DrvFs_filesystem]]

**Setup**

* Enable Developer mode in Windows settings so that symlinks can be created without elevated privileges.
* Mount the NTFS drive with metadata option. [`/etc/wsl.conf`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config) can be used or a line such as `C: /mnt/c drvfs metadata` can be added in `/etc/fstab`.
* Create an empty directory for the repo.
    * With File Explorer go to Properties/Security/Advanced.
        * Give "Authenticated Users" permission to [“Write attributes”, “Create files”, “Create folders” and “Delete subfolders and files”](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/improved-per-directory-case-sensitivity-support-in-wsl/) for this folder and subfolders.
    * Enable case sensitivity with `setfattr -n system.wsl_case_sensitive -v 1 <path>`.
        * This attribute will be inherited by new subdirectories but will not be automatically recursively applied to existing subdirectories.
        * Set this attribute to 0 as appropriate if you do not have files that differ only by case, or if you have non-default git-annex [[tuning]].
        * This attribute can be queried with `getfattr -n system.wsl_case_sensitive <path>`.
* Initialize the repo.
    * Set `git config annex.crippledfilesystem true` immediately after `git annex init` to avoid triggering the above two bugs.
* Open Properties/Security/Advanced for .git/annex/objects.
    * Deny "Authenticated Users" write permissions for files only and select "Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object".

** Setup with repo cloned from SSH **

* If you encounter problems with older versions of git-annex.
    * Create a local git-annex branch from the remote branch.
    * Remove the origin remote.
    * Do `git annex init` and other setup.
    * Add back the origin remote.

** Using symlinks and locked files **

* Symlinks might be broken and can be fixed by recreating them. You can also delete them and do a `git checkout`.
