This tip is mostly talking about the web special remote, which is unusual
in that it's enabled by default. So there is nothing in `.git/config` about
it.

Any special remote that you set up with `initremote` or `enableremote` does
have a section in `.git/config` same as a regular git remote would
(just with git-annex specific configs in there). So `git remote`
can be used to list it, and `git remote rm` will disable it.

As far as setting annex-ignore goes, it prevents git-annex from using that
remote *unless* you explicitly ask it to. @yarikoptic's example above
sets that for a remote and then explicitly fscks it.
