I agree, submodules are the usual way to nest git repositories, and will
more or less just work with git-annex.

I think that the author of this tip is wanting to version control the
contents of `.git` itself. Eg, to version control `.git/config` and 
`.git/hooks/`.

One problem with this approach is that when the outer repository has
"dotgit/annex/objects/` files added to it, running `git-annex drop` inside
the nested git repository will drop the content, but the outer repository
will still contain a copy too. You would have to use `git-annex unused`
to eventually clean up those copies. And it stores 2 copies of every
annexed file to use it this way.
