@joey Thanks. I don't think 2 is even possible since I just installed git-annex. 1 seems likely. I'm guessing that could occur if I previously ran `git annex add` with a different `annex.largefiles` that caused some files to be added (though not committed) via git rather than git-annex? That's roughly the scenario I was in.
