@lh two possibilities are:

1. When `git add` is run, git-annex does some additional checks to detect
   things like a file that was checked into git before but has been
   renamed, and will avoid annexing such a file even when annex.largefiles
   says to.
2. Perhaps `git add` is finding some other git-annex
   version that behaves differently. Seems unlikely, but possible.
