I have a repo where I have run:
    git annex config --set annex.largefiles '(mimeencoding=binary and not mimetype=inode/symlink) or mimeencoding=unknown-8bit'

My git-annex package is built with support for MIME detection. It works for other files. But I have noticed that for certain files, `git add` does not add them to the annex. I have verified the MIME type and encoding with `file` so that I could check `git annex matchexpression`, and it matches. What might be happening here?
