You could add a config to the script that skips over files larger than a
certian size.

Or for that matter, the script could be adapted to filter the files
to only include images/videos, using eg:

	git annex find --mimetype='image/*' --or --mimetype='video/*'

Should be a fairly easy change, patches accepted.
