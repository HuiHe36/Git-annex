Running extract on very large files (system backups) can be too long (killed it after running several hours). 
In general `extract` seem slow on tar.gz archives. 

I added `timeout 100s` before the tool is called in the pre commit script:

`LC_ALL=C timeout 100s $tool_exec \"./$f\" | ...`

This allows to have the commit to complete in reasonable time, probably loosing some metadata.
