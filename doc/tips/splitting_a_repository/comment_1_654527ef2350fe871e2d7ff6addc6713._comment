2021 update: The new [[git-annex-filter-branch]] command
can be used to produce a filtered version of the git-annex branch that only
includes information for the files you want. I have updated the tip to
show how to do it that way, and kept the old way as an alternative

The old, alternative way is a simple way to split a repository, but the
resulting split git repository will be larger than is really necessary.
(The new method avoids this problem.)

When you `dropunused` all the hard links that are not present in the
repository, git-annex will commit a log to the git-annex branch saying "I
don't have this content" for each of them. That seems unnecessary since
it probably does not have an earlier log saying it contained the content
that was hard linked into it, and perhaps could be improved in git-annex
to not record that unncessarily, but that's what it does currently.

So I suggest running `git annex forget` after the dropunused or at some
later point. That will delete all traces of those log files from
the git-annex branch.
