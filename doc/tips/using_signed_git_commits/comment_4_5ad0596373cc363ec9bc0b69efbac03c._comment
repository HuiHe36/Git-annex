Are we still concerned about this? Well, git has a workaround for SHA1's
insecurity and will eventually change hashes. There are plenty of other
reasons to want to sign git commits, certianly.

The webapp bypasses gpg signing because it commits automatically and
potentially frequently, and depending on how gpg handles password
prompting, that could flood the user with repeated password prompts.
But you can change this default with the `annex.allowsign` configuration.

(Commits to the git-annex branch are also not signed by default, for similar
reasons. Also, the risks of SHA1 collisions involving the git-annex branch
seem small to nonexistant, since that branch only records bookeeping
information git-annex cares about, and a small amount of configuration.
git-annex does not use data from that branch in any way that would let
an untrusted person who modified the branch do anything malicious.)
