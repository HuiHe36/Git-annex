Thanks @jkniiv, that's good to hear. That is exactly the results I would
have hoped for for a repository like yours. To speed up the checkout
of the annexed files in your case will need improvements to git,
probably. But the crucial thing is it's not gotten worse, and the other
checkout improved a lot.

I would be curious how you find `git add`'s performance now, if you ever
use that to add large annexed files.
