@datamanager the `git-annex unannex` command can't rewrite git history,
it just stops further tracking of an annexed file by git. Any way you would
usually scrub an unwanted commit out of git's history can be used with
git-annex; scrubbing mentioned of hashes out of the git-annex branch's
history gets more involved.

Once you have run `git-annex unannex` on a file, it's not annexed, so
commands like `git-annex whereis` will not have anything to say about it.
