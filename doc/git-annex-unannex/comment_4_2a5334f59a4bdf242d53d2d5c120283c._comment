Essentially, I want to tell git-annex to forget about my file; remove it from the annex, and put the original file back where it was in my local filesystem. 

I made the mistake of adding a list of files accidentally, and then panicked. I even ran git-annex-sync, so there's now a commit on the git-annex branch with my accidentally added files. I thought that maybe I could just revert that commit and all would be well, but I thought I'd seek some assistance before doing that. 

I haven't copied the files to any other remotes as yet, but git-annex-whereis returns nothing when I give it one of the paths I added by mistake, so those files seem to be in some kind of limbo, where they're in the annex, but it doesn't know about them. I am not sure what I broke along the way.
