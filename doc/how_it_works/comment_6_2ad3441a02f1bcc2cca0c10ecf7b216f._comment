    This is like a 1000ft overview, but doesn't actually say where the files are actually stored or how they're synchronized.

It does:
\"[...] That's a fancy way to say that git-annex stores the actual file content somewhere under .git/annex/. (See [[internals]] for details.)\". <br>
When using SHA256E hashing (the default), a file will end up for example under `.git/annex/f87/4d5/SHA256E-s0--e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`.

    Does one need to setup a samba, sftp, or AWS bucket to contain the large files?

No.

    Does a clone of the repo pull down all of the large files, or just the files in the working directory that's checked out?

No and no. You decide yourself (via [[git-annex-get]]/[[git-annex-drop]]/[[git-annex-copy]]/[[git-annex-move]]) or automated (via `git annex sync --content`/[[git-annex-wanted]]/[[git-annex-preferred-content]]) what large files are stored where. If a file is not present you will just see a broken symlink.

    Are files transferred via direct connection to other repos (ex the same SSH tunnel that git uses, http, etc) or is there a UDP p2p layer like syncthing or bittorrent that might struggle with certain NAT situations?

Yes and no. git-annex is very flexible, it can also communicate via tor.

    The sentence \"A file's content can be transferred from one repository to another by git-annex. Which repositories contain a given value is tracked by git-annex (see location tracking).\" makes it sound like the old versions of the large files only exist on computers that checked out those copies. Does this mean old versions of a file might be lost forever if a single clone is deleted and temporarily unavailable if clones that contain those revisions of the file are offline?

Yes and yes. If you don't copy the file elsewhere (with the commands mentioned above) before deleting the repo, that version is lost.

    Is there a way to ensure that a clone has all copies of all of the files (for example, when using git with a central trusted server)?

`git annex get --all`/`git annex wanted server anything` 

I strongly suggest you to create a throwaway repository and try things out.
