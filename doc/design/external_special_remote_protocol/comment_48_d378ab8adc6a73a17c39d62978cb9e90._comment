It's already possible, and in fact very easy to support resuming downloads.
When the filename that you're asked to download to already exists, you can
simply check its size and resume downloading to it where
the previous download left off.

When you send PROGRESS, the value should be the same as the current 
size of the file. That is always the case really, but the distinction
between file size and amount you've downloaded only matters when resuming.

Another way to support resuming, when talking to an API that does not,
is to encourage users of your remote to configure chunking with a small
enough chunk size. git-annex will then handle resuming by re-starting
on the last incomplete chunk. In this case, you'll be downloading each
chunk to a separate file, so you will not need to do anything to support
resuming.

If a remote does any kind of out of order downloading (like bittorrent
does), it needs to avoid writing to the file out of order,
with holes in the middle of it. Such holes would mess up a resume of
the download of the same object by another remote.
