So you have several remotes with the same name, probably all but
this one you want to use were false starts or created by accident.

In this unusual situation, `git-annex enableremote` picks one more or less at
random.

(Normally this is prevented by `git-annex initremote`, which won't use a
name that already exists, but initializing remotes with the same name in
different clones and merging is one way it could happen.)

What you can do instead is specify the uuid or description of the remote.
Eg:

	git-annex enableremote e7e3e2b7-40e7-4b10-83f6-bb5425f33d6d

The other thing you can do if you want is to mark all the other
uuids with this name as dead, and then tell git-annex to forget about dead
remotes. Doing this will leave only the one that you did not mark as dead,
so enableremote by name will do what you want.

	git-annex dead ebca6ee8-1baa-4a47-ae85-0a5b65db73f6
	git-annex dead 69acaaf2-e58b-463d-a578-e2418df5c6b0
	git-annex dead 2e771318-83eb-4beb-85f4-567896b0e835
	git-annex forget --drop-dead
