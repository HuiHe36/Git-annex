Thanks for verifying. If decryption is failing, I'd guess you somehow
picked the wrong one to enable. The encryption information is included in
the remote's configuration, which could otherwise be close enough that it's
able to get files from the remote, but then fail to decrypt them.

Also FWIW, I'm pushing some changes that improve `git-annex enableremote`
in this situation, so it does not choose a random remote to enable.
