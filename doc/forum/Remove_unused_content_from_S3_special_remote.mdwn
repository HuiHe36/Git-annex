I've made a small mess of things and hoping I could get some advice to clean things up.

I was experimenting with using a special remote (backblaze over s3). I had it synced to a repo, working fine, but then I wanted to re-use the bucket for another repo (and I removed the annex-uuid file so I can re-init -- I realize now that there is a better way).

I'm in a situation now where the bucket has: 
  - all the content for my current repo
  - content from my previous repo (unencrypted, but unwanted by me)

Is there a way to tell git-annex to "remove all files/keys from the special remote that aren't in my current repo"?

I tried "git annex unused --from=backblaze", but this finds nothing.
