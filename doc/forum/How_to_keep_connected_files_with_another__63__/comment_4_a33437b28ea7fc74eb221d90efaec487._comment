One other option is to `tar` up each movie and all associated files into one archive, and annex that.

There's a [special remote in DataLad](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/blob/master/datalad/customremotes/archives.py) for accessing individual files inside annexed archives, though I guess in your case you'd normally want all files anyway.
