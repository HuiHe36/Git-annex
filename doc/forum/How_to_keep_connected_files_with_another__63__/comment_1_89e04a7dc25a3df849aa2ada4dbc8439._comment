You could make the subtitles wanted in every repo so that all subtitles are present in every repo. Since they are small, the overhead shouldn't be large.

Or you could directly add them to git (\"small files\") so they are also present everywhere. On a fresh repo, this would help a bit with speed too since git-annex then doesn't need to keep track of the location of these small files.

Or (depending on how you configured your preferred content) you could increase numcopies just for the small files. See [[walkthrough/backups/]].

Unfortunately, preferred-content can't directly relate multiple files with each other. git-annex iterates over each file in the tree and checks if preferred-content matches for that particular file.
