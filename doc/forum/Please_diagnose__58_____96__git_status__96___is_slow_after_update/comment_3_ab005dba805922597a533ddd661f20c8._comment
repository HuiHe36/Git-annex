`git-annex sync` has been very slow on one of my repositories the last few times I ran it. An operation that used to run in well less than a minute (via USB 2.0) was now taking upwards of one hour. I do have many files there that are not being tracked by git.

I followed *ainohzoa*'s description to confirm I was seeing the same issue and tried the process that worked for them: running `git status` twice. Although it took a few hours to complete, things went back to normal after that. Thank you, *ainohzoa*.
