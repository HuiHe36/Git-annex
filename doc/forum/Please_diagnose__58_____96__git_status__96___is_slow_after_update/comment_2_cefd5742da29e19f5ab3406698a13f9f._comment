git can sometimes get into a situation where it is unsure about the status
of working tree files, and when those files are not git-annex symlinks but
either unlocked git-annex files or regular files checked into git, it needs
to run `git-annex smudge` once per file. That can take a long time when it
somehow needs to check many files.

This kind of slowdown is largely avoided by setting:

	git config filter.annex.process 'git-annex filter-process'

Which will be handled automatically by a future upgrade.
