After running a `git status` today (the first time running it was slow as usual) the problem seems to have gone away. Perhaps it just needed to rebuild some kind of cache or something. I believe that I had waited for a `git status` command to completely finish before, so maybe it takes several tries to resolve this performance problem? Or possibly I'm misremembering and I never actually waited for the `git status` command to fully finish. I'm baffled by this, but happy that it's back to normal. I'll post an update if the problem comes back.
