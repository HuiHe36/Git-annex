# Warning: linker on each command in Android 8.20210429

Recently (about 2 or 3 weeks ago) each 'git annex <command>' in Termux for Android throws multiple warnings. The exact warning message is this:

`WARNING: linker: Warning: failed to find generated linker configuration from "/linkerconfig/ld.config.txt"`

The amount of warnings depends on the command, e.g.
* `$ git annex --version` --> 2 warnings
* `git annex status` --> 3 warnings
* `$ git annex sync origin` --> 80 warnings

The issue was already raised in the Termux matrix/discord, as i suspected it might by coming from Termux. They suspect it is a vendor specific problem, although one of them could also reproduce it via `git-annex-install` on a pixel4a.

The warning stems from the function `get_ld_config_file_path` in linker.cpp as part of the Android source code. I could not find any call to this in git-annex's source code, so it seems like it is called through some dependency.

As this issue greatly affects the usability of git-annex on Android, i would very much appreciate any work to solve this (if possible, i.e. if the issue is even caused by git-annex).
