I have found a difference.  The name of the submodule is `futhark-benchmarks`.  On the checkout where `git-annex` works, a directory `.git/modules/futhark-benchmarks/annex` exists.  On the checkout where `git-annex` does not work, this directory is missing.  What could cause it to be lost?  The repository that fails is checked out by Buildbot (and a similar issue occurs on GitHub Actions for that matter).  Maybe they prune things they do not understand, somehow?
