Hmm, it should work as you described it. Did you run `git annex sync` on the 2nd repo _after_ running `git annex sync` on the 1st repo (where you copied the files to the ipfs remote)? Can you post the output of the following actions, in that order:

    repo1# git annex copy somefile --to=ipfs
    repo1# git annex sync
    repo2# git annex sync
