I was looking at the conda forge, and was surprised at the sheer number of
downloads of git-annex from there --  211,462!

I suspect that counts each successive upgrade as a download as well, and
perhaps some users are using containers that get rebuilt etc, so maybe it
needs to be divided by 10 or 100 to get the number of users. Still, this is
a sizeable number of downloads.

Thanks, Ilya, for making this available!
