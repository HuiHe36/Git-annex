The shared encryption key is what git-annex passes to gpg as
"C:\\Users\\REDACTED\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\gpg8159".

From the other forum thread,
[[Failing_to_get_files_from_rclone_special_remote]], 
you had many special remotes that somehow existed with
the same name.

There's a big question mark over how you even got into that state.
initremote does not let two special remotes with the same name be created
in the same repository so normally it would be rather hard to accomplish
once, let alone multiple times. Without understanding more, it's hard for
me to guess what has happened.

It also might be some problem with your gpg on windows. 
googling for "gpg: decryption failed: Bad session key" seems to find that
the problem is split between the wrong encryption key and some kind of gpg
bugs.

If you still have the data, would deleting that special remote and starting
over with setting up a new one (with a different name!) be an option?
