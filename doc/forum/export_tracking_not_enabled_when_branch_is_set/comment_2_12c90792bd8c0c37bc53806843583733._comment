Aha! I was able to reproduce it by following [[tips/android_sync_with_adb]],
but only configure the remote with exporttree=yes, while leaving off the
importtree=yes.

	git init foo
	cd foo
	git-annex init
	git-annex initremote d type=directory directory=../d encryption=none exporttree=yes
	git config remote.d.annex-tracking-branch master:d
	touch foo
	git annex add foo
	git-annex sync --content d

Alternatively -- and I think this is probably what you did -- do include
importtree=yes, but the special remote is actually empty, it does not
include any files to import yet. And the directory you have configured to
export does not exist in your repository.

In both these cases, the export fails because it is unable to determine what
to export to the remote, because the current branch does not contain the
subdirectory that it's configured to export.

I have fixed the warning message in this case, and the thing to do is just to
create the subdirectory you configured it to export, and git add files to it.
Or, in your case, you could put a file on the android device, which it would
then import, and so get the subdirectory populated that way.
