Seems it is not that. I tried it and following
[[tips/android_sync_with_adb]] works, and that tip
has initremote followed by configuring annex-tracking-branch,
followed by git-annex sync.

Aha! I was able to reproduce it by following that tip, but only
configure the remote with exporttree=yes, while leaving off the
importtree=yes.

	git init foo
	cd foo
	git-annex init
	git-annex initremote d type=directory directory=../d encryption=none exporttree=yes
	git config remote.d.annex-tracking-branch master:d
	touch foo
	git annex add foo
	git-annex sync --content d

So the problem is that it is unable to read the export commit for the
tracking branch, because it has not imported from the remote.

First running `git-annex export` does work around this problem.
