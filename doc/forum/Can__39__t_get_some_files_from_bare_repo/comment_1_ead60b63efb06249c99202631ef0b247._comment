Note that 8.20.200226 is not a valid git-annex version and it would be good
to know the actual version used on WSL.

The mixed-case folder name is what git-annex uses when storing files in a
git repository that is not bare. The lower-case 3 letter name is used in a bare
repository. It is also used when git-annex detects a crippled filesystem
-- which it likely would for a USB drive using FAT or something. 
Does the repository have annex.crippledfilesystem set in its git config?

Ok, I found a way to reproduce this. I made a repository with
annex.crippledfilesystem set, and copied a file to it. Then I unset 
annex.crippledfilesystem. Getting the file in another repository then
fails.

git-annex does already deal with cases where a non-bare repo is converted
to bare, by trying both names, but it does not in this case.

I've fixed the problem, but am still curious about how you got into this
situation. Anyway, install a git-annex autobuild a few hours after this
comment to get the fix.
