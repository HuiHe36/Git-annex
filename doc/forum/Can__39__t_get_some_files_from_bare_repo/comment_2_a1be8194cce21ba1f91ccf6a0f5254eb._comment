Thanks for you answer! 
My WSL repo works on FAT32 so it's crippled. The version it the exactly what the git annex says me by ```git annex version``` on WSL. May be Ubuntu developers repacked it?

# As I seem to have fixed it
I started ```git annex fix``` in my bare repo, and this command found that approximately a half of files aren't present though they ought to be there according to log. Log was fixed in three hours and then I synced repos. But my WSL repo is behind a NAT so I will sync it in several days and I a little afraid of some problems with it.

Is there some advices to change settings for repos to avoid problems?
In git settings of the bare repo \"crippled filesystem\" is true.
