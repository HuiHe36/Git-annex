I'm currently using a directory special remote with encryption for dropable storage for incompressible files but I also need one for compressible text files.

Borg would be my go-to for encryption and compression for append-only storage needs and even comes with the additional benefit of best-in-class dedup (though that is not important in this case). Unfortunately, I need to be able to drop files from this remote, so Borg is out of the question.

An encrypted directory would be an option since gpg does its own compression before encryption but I turned that off globally because it uses a horribly inefficient compression algorithm (gzip) which I never want when using it manually and definitely don't want on my already-existing encrypted directory special remote full of incompressible files.

I'd be fine with gzip for this particular purpose but I haven't found a way to make git-annex call gpg with a certain compression flag in one remote but not the other. LMK if you're aware of one.

Two other possible options I can think of that aren't implemented yet (AFAICT) would be:

* customisable compression for special remotes  
  (This would probably be the best option; efficient, customisable and simple)
* storing the text files in an actual git repo encrypted with gcrypt

How do you store compressible files which you might need to drop?
