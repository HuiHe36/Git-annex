exporttree is already supported by both. importtree is unlikely to be
supported. It's difficult to support this without opening up a very real
possibility of data loss. If you're importing and exporting to the same
remote, what happens when there's a conflict? Eg, whatever else is writing
files to the remote writes to a file, but you locally modify the same file,
and export a tree, without importing the new version first. That
would overwrite the modified file on the remote, losing data.

All the special remotes that support exporttree+importtree are able to
avoid losing data in this scenario. (At least as well as git is able to,
there are similar races when git updates a working tree at the same time
you modify a file in the working tree, but the timing of it makes it very
unlikely, so much that noone seems to worry about it).
See also [[todo/import_tree_from_rsync_special_remote]]

I have not felt comfortable giving users a loaded gun in this case. So only
exporttree is supported, because the user doesn't expect something
else to be writing to files on that remote, or if they do, they don't
have any reason to expect git-annex to deal with it well.

Anyway, it seems to me it should be possible to install git-annex on
your pinephone and connect the repos using ssh.
