Yeah, that's the pattern for any special remote: Initialize once and
enableremote everywhere else. Otherwise you have a bunch of different
special remotes that happened to be initialized more or less the same
but git-annex doesn't know you consider them all to be the same place.

I'd be keen to improve whatever docs might have led to the multiple
initremote mistake. The man page for initremote does
say to use enableremote in other clones. But maybe you were
following a page like 
[[tips/using_borg_for_efficient_storage_of_old_annexed_files]] and just
assumed you'd follow that same procedure in each clone?
