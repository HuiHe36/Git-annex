Leave it to the Grand Wizard himself :)

With a few tweaks based on your explanation, this appears to be working smoothly. I think our issue was caused by attempting to connect repos that were individually initialized (i.e., with `git init`, `git annex init`, and `git annex initremote` on each workstation); by performing this initialization routine only on a single workstation, then following through with `git clone` and `git annex enableremote` on each additional workstation, the syncing works as expected.

Thank you for your work and guidance! This is very exciting.

The next thing to figure out is Borg repo mirroring to alleviate the overhead caused by Step 1(b) in the procedure above. Currently, the number of `borg create` operations each workstation must perform is multiplied by the number of Borg special remotes, which obviously doesn’t scale well. Ideally, a workstation could create an archive on a single server—say, the nearest available—offloading to the server the burden of creating archives on the remaining Borg repos. It sounds good in my head, but I struggle to find prior art for something like Borg-based swarms for eventual consistency.
