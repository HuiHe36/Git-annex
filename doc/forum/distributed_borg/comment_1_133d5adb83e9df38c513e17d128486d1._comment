This should be possible to set up. This is just a special remote that is
accessible from several clones of the repository, and git-annex is able to
get files that were sent from another clone to the special remote, once the
git-annex branch gets synced between the two clones.

You have to use `git annex initremote` a single time to set up the borg
special remote, and then use `git annex enableremote` on every other clone
to access it. Since initremote borg needs the borgrepo= parameter, which
then gets used to access it from the other clones, it would make sense to
use ssh user@host:path syntax, with a shared user account, or perhaps
host:path if the permissions on the server allow multiple users to access
the borg repo.
