I just wanted to confirm that the suggestion of linking .git/annex (as opposed to .git/annex/objects)  appears to work as well.   I'm not sure what I did wrong on my earlier attempt.

Performance measurements will not be available for quite some time, but anecdotally both approaches seem extremely fast.
