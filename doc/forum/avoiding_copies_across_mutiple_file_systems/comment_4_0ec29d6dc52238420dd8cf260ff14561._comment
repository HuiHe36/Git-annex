Sorry for the delay in responding.   I had a short vacation and jury duty that kept me from responding immediately.

The symlink approach suggested by @Lukey appears to work quite well from my limited testing this far.       The git-worktree approach unfortunately required additional write permissions (as noted by @Joey) in the primary repository, and is thus not our preferred approach.

As far as the performance consequences to the symlink option, my tests thus far did not show any obvious performance consequences related to multi-filesystem involvement.   Certainly my test repo (~100 files of 50 MB each) seemed to perform quite well, so a real test may effectively require deploying the full data set in this manner.

I had previously tried @Joey's suggestion of symlinking just .git/annex rather than .git/annex/objects.     My recollection is that I got error messages, but will test again shortly.
