Have I understood you correctly, you have a \"primary\" repository (with all data/keys present), accessible by the clients via NFS/cifs/whatever? And the clients(/\"experiments\") want to check out a specific version/branch from that repo?

I think you have two alternatives to cloning it everywhere including all keys:

a) Every client clones the git repo (and remove the \"origin\" remote to ensure that nothing flows back), creates a symlink from `.git/annex/objects` to `/path/to/primary/.git/annex/objects` and checks out whatever version/branch it wants. Easy.

b) Every client uses the primary repo, but via its own worktree (See `git-worktree`). git-annex supports external worktrees, but I'm not sure what problems could arise in this particular setup.
