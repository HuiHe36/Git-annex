There is a bug report that looks very similar to what is being reported
here, in particular the doubled "failed to retrieve" with no other
information: <https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__34__failed_to_send_content_to_remote__34__/>

The most recent git-annex release adds some additional error messages in
some cases that could be the reason for the failure. The fact that rsync
succeeds and then the get fails suggests rather strongly that git-annex
thinks the file got modified while rsync was running -- which the new
version will display an informative message about.

(Please do not use this forum for bug reports; it is not an effective BTS
since nothing ever gets closed.)
