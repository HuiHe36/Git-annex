Thanks joey, your script is useful and I can use it as a workaround if necessary.

I still don't understand the reason behind the behaviour. Why does `annex.synconlyannex = true` cause content to be synced? Wouldn't it be simpler to just say content is synced iff `annex.synccontent` is set to true? (I leave at the default, `false`, because I don't want content to be synced, but that does not help.)
