The merge commits that git-annex sync still makes with annex.autocommit
set to false are the same as the merge commits that git pull makes
(with the addition of merge conflict resolution that annex.resolvemerge
can prevent).

The idea with annex.synconlyannex is that a user, who has their own
git workflow already and does not want to change it, can set that and use
git-annex sync to sync all the git-annex data.

Adding new configurability to git-annex sync is a tarpit: If left unchecked
it will parameterize every single bit of it. So, having realized this,
I prefer to only add new configurability only when I have a broad
use case for it, like the one that led to annex.synconlyannex.

It is easy enough to write a small shell script that syncs only the
git-annex branch, using appropriately low-level commands:

	#!/bin/sh
	git fetch origin git-annex
	git annex merge
	git push origin git-annex
