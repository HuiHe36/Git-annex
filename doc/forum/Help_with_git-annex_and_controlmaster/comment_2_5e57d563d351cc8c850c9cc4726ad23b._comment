Oh. Wow. That's a big man page...

Okay. So if I run `git config annex.sshcaching false`, then things are happier. Well:

```
‚ùØ git annex get file1.nc4
get file1.nc4 (from origin...)

  You have enabled concurrency, but git-annex is not able to use ssh connection caching. This may result in multiple ssh processes prompting for passwords at the same time.

  annex.sshcaching is not set to true
ok
(recording state in git...)
```

Now, reading the man pages, I see that the default concurrency is 1, so I think I'm safe?  Or is there perhaps something I should use to tell it \"nope\" for that?
