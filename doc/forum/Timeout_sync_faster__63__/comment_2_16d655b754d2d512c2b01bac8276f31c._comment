You may want to set ServerAliveInterval in your ssh config,
or some of the related options like ServerAliveCountMax and
TCPKeepAlive. See `man ssh_config`

I think that normally, ssh does detect when a connection to a server has
gone away, just due to the tcp connection dropping. But that may take some
time to happen.
