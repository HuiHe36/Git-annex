Is maxvmem what top would display as "VIRT"?

Sometimes a few years ago, ghc started just mapping the entire available
memory range, which makes it appear in VIRT that it's using the entire size
of the system memory. Of course, the actual RSS is much lower. It appears to
have been 40 mb for you.

git-annex add can add files of arbitrary size without buffering them all in
memory.
