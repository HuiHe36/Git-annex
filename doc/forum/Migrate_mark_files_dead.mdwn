Through several migrations, and migrations leave duplicate files.

The man page warns about this and tells to use `annex unused` to find them.
I'd usually copy the new files around, drop the old ones and mark the old ones dead,
but alas, manual things are not always done.

To clean up after sloppy migrations,
or after deciding that I really want to get rid of the old files,
I'd like a tool to

* find files that were migrated,
* do some sanity checks,
* drop them from all the remotes (with extreme prejudice, as even unused files are usually subject to numcopies), and
* declare them dead (which can only happen once they're gone from all remotes).

I've written a tool that does all these. It's available at [[migrate-mark-dead.py]];
see its head for documentation.
This is a tool for forcibly dropping files,
so use with the adaequate caution and at your own risk.

Since, I can reclaim my disk space *and* run `git annex fsck --all` with good results again.
