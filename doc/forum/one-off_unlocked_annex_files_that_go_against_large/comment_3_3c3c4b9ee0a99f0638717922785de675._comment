Well Lukey was right, fixing this causes other breakage. Here's
the bug report about what my change broke:
[[bugs/case_where_using_pathspec_with_git-commit_leaves_s]]

As well as the case in that bug, [[tips/largefiles]] has a recipe to convert
an annexed file to be stored in git, which the change broke. 
The recipe has `git annex add --force-small` be run on a file, which in turn
runs `git add` on the file, which runs the smudge filter. So if the smudge
filter then sees an annexed inode and keeps it annexed, it is going against
what the user is trying to do there.

So the change has been reverted.

I guess that both problems could be avoided by having git-annex add not run
git add, but stage the file in the index itself. (IIRC there were some
reasons to use git add there, to do with .gitignore.)

But I'm doubtful now that all problems could be avoided. For one,
consider what happens when the user follows the recipe to convert an
annexed file to be stored in git, running `git annex add --force-small
file`, which does store it in git. But then, if the smudge clean filter runs
on the file later for any reason, it would still see a known annexed inode,
and convert it back to being stored in the annex.
