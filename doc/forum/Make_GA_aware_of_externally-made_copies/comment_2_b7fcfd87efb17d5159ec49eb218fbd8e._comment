I think it should be possible to get this to work with chunking, if you
have git-annex version 8.20201103 or newer, and if you configure the second
special remote with the same chunk size.

git-annex records state about a special remote's chunks, and that state is
not available for the second special remote. Which used to prevent accessing
chunks when the information is not available, but that version made it fall
back to trying chunks of the configured chunk size.

See the bug report that resulted in that change for details:
[[bugs/fsck_--key_without___34__chunking__34___information_in_git-annex_does_not_try_chunks]]

Oh also this only works with keys that have a recorded size. Which is most
of them, but git-annex addurl --fast adds keys without a recorded size.

---

An alternative you might consider is to use the --sameas flag to initremote
when setting up the second remote. Then git-annex would consider the two
remotes as one repository, which means it only considers them to be one
copy, but also it can retrieve content from either.

If git-annex only had a way to treat a repository a more than 1 copy, that
would do just what you want. I do think there might be the possibility to
add such a feature, but it would need some thought.
