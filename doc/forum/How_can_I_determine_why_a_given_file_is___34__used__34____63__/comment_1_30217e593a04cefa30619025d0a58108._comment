Is it in use in git's index? git-annex addunused adds a link to the working
tree, and also stages it in the index. You said
"I rm'ed the symlink", but that would leave it in the index, so still used.

(It's also theoretically possible for git-annex unused to incorrectly
decide something is unused that is not -- it uses a bloom filter which can
have false positives -- but this is highly unlikely unless your repo has
a huge number of files in it. The annex.bloomaccuracy and annex.bloomaccuracy
configs can be used to tweak the bloom filter.)
