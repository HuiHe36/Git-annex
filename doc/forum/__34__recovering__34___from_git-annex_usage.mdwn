# Past Usage of git-annex

I used to have git(-annex) repositories for different projects and data types...
so I managed all my images in one repository, movies in an other and so on.
At some point I had an central Server an moved files to that remote.

So far so easy and good.

# Current Situation

Then there was the time, that I killed my central Server,
and "lost" access to my files I moved there
and "lost" also the synchronization path between my laptop and my desktop pc

I have a backup of these remotes (scped to a external hdd), but currently have no
clue how I teach my local repository that the central Server remote is now
just a local hdd remote.

Probably I am just confused how I handeled git-annex till now

What would be a best practice to teach an repository that an remote has moved its location?
And maybe recover my moved files, that are hopefully still somewhere around.
