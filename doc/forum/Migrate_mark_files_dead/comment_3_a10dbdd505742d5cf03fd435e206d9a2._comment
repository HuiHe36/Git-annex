A change in git-annex 8.20210630 is relevant to this discussion:

	  * Dropping an unused object with drop --unused or dropunused will
	    mark it as dead, preventing fsck --all from complaining about it
	    after it's been dropped from all repositories.

So, you should not need to remember to mark files as dead. Just cleaning
up from the migration once will suffice. Of course, you'll still need to do
whatever dropping of the unused content from remotes you want to do.
