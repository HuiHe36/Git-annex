git-annex now has the ability to import a tree of files from a
directory special remote, which results in a remote tracking branch, the
same as you'd have after fetching a git remote.

	git-annex initremote dvd type=directory directory=/path/to/DVD encryption=none importtree=yes
	git-annex import master --from dvd --no-content

The --no-content option avoids copying files to the local disk, although
their content still will have to be read to hash them. If you want to
copy the files from the disk at the same time, omit that option.

After that, you can use the dvd/master branch it created in whatever way
you desire. Also if you want the discs files to end up in a subdirectory,
that can be specified when you import, eg "master:dvd" will put the files
into a dvd/ subdirectory.

Using this with multiple discs would probably work best if there was a way
to mount each DVD to its own unique location.
