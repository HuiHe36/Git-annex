I wasn't clear enough, or maybe I did something wrong when testing the directory special remote.

When using standard git-annex repositories for everything as explained in comment 14 I get this:

```
$ git log --graph --oneline
*   5555555555 (HEAD -> master) amended commit 2
|\  
| * 4444444444 (DVD1) DVD1
*   3333333333  amended commit 1
|\  
| * 2222222222 (CD1) CD1
*   1111111111  init
```

The master branch tracks only the contents of my local HDD (note that in step 4 I edit the working directory to my liking and amend the automatic ```git-annex sync``` commit), and the CD1 branch contains only what's in that disc and nothing else, such that ```git checkout 2222222222``` or ```git checkout CD1``` replaces everything in the working directory with the contents of CD1, similar to mounting the physical disc and browsing its filesystem.

Using the directory special remote, the contents of my master branch are combined with the contents of the special remote, so the same ```git checkout CD1``` command wouldn't replicate exactly what's on CD1, the master branch directory tree would still be present after the branch switch.
