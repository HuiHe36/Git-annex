Aha, that's what I was missing!

I was working under the wrong assumption that the git-annex location tracking was tied in some way to the master branch and that alternate branches required shared history with master to have their contents tracked.

Wholly independent branches for each disc is exactly what I want, thanks Lukey and Joey for your suggestions.
