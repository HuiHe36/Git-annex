@Atemu would have been a good idea to file a bug about that.

I think the assistant would probably eventually get around to pushing a
commit that you made with annex.autocommit=false, but it did not promptly
notice such commits and push them.

I've made a small change that does make it promptly push commits that
were made to the current branch.
