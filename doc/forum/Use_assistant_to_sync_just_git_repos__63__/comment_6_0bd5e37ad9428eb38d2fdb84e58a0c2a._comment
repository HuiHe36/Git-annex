So I tried `annex.autocommit=false` but, contrary to what the man page suggests and what Joey said, the that also disables syncing.  
It's actually the very setting the assistant modifies when toggling *syncing* on a repo.

How can I configure the assistant such that it only syncs commits I have added manually and does not create commits on its own?
