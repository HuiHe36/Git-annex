Migrating to URL will not do anything since they already are url keys.

This could be scripted using `git-annex examinekey` to 
convert such a key into one without a size, and then using
`git-annex rekey`, which lets the new key for a file be specified.

However, that command is a low level plumbing command, and does not copy
over the url list from the old to the new key as migrate does (nor other
metadata). So you would also have to use `git-annex addurl file url`
afterwards to add the url, and use `git-annex metadata` if you have
metadata. Very unergonomic.
