I'm sure this used to work, but I've confirmed it no longer does
and opened a bug report [[sync_does_not_propagate_forgetfulness]]

Update: The bug I found is fixed. I'm fairly sure it caused the problem you
saw as well, although I have not tried to reproduce your exact situation.

Once you upgrade to the next release of git-annex (or tomorrow's daily
build), you will need to re-run the git-annex forget command, and then it
should propagate that new forgetting properly.
