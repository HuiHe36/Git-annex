Hello Everyone, basically my site is fully based on HTML but due to google optimisation, I have to migrate my site on PHP or any CMS. But while migration I am facing issues on the C panel and particularly on <a href=\"https://www.exactlly.com/blog/index.php/keep-hr-compliance-issues-at-bay-with-hr-software/\">hr compliance</a> and related things. So can anyone from here please check once and let me know once. Thanks in advance.
