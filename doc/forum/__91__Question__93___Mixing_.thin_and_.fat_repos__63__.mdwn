Have tested this setup locally - and it seems to work well.<br>
Asking for a sanity check:<br>
<br>
One default repo.<br>
One .thin repo.<br>
Synching using sync and get.<br>
<br>
The fat repo holds the versioned changes of the file. <br>
The thin repo holds only the newest version of the file. <br>
<br>
Can edit / sync both ways and the above two statements remain true.<br>
<br>
<br>
Is this use case intended?<br>
If so git-annex is brilliant =).<br>
