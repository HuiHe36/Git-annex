Thanks for the support guys!  I really appreciate knowing that others have struggled with similar issues and I'm not giving up yet.  

@Lukey That's a great idea, except I'm already doing that.  The issue really wasn't to do with annex, as it wasn't the hash files names.  I was downloading torrent files directly to the annex so I could keep the torrent link active without keeping two copies of the files.  But torrent filenames are packed with information and thus long, leading to my issue.  I just changed the filename and broke the torrent link.  Frustrating, but ultimately not really a big deal. Thanks for the suggestion though.

@Ilya_Shlyakhter Thanks for the support.  I'll go through the Main Page again as well as that Internals page.  I think I skipped the Internals page when I was going through the documentation a few months ago, but looking at it now it looks pretty illuminating.  I'll also check out using a VM, but I may just decide to make the jump to linux and use a windows VM there.
