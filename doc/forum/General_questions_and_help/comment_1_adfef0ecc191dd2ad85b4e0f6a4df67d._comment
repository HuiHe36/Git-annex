Hi,<br>
What may help with the filenames too long is putting the repository directly under `C:` like `C:\repo`. The reason is that Windows paths are limited to a maximum of 260? bytes and if you have it under like `C:\Users\bla\loong\path\repo` then the whole path to the keys (`C:\Users\bla\loong\path\repo\.git\annex\objects\xyz\xyz\SHA256E-e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`) might be too long. <br>
You could also try with a different [[backends]] like `SHA1` since then the hash part (`SHA256E-e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`) is shorter.
