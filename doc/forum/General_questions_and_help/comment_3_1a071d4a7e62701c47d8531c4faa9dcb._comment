>tried using git-annex on Windows and gave up, using it inside an Ubuntu guest VM via VirtualBox

I meant, I ended up using it *instead* inside an Ubuntu guest VM via VirtualBox, and that has worked very well.   The only caveat is that the files have to be stored inside VirtualBox volumes; trying to access Windows files via shared folder [[runs into VirtualBox filesystem issues|bugs/removeLink_failed_when_initializing_a_repo_in_a_VirtualBox_shared_folder]].
