It's possible to limit a view to a subdirectory, by
using something like `git annex view 'foo/=*'`

It might still take a while to generate that view, but
once you're in that view, you can use `git annex vfilter`
to further filter to tags, and it will only look at the files from the
subdirectory, so will run faster. And `git annex vpop` will
quickly undo a view change.
