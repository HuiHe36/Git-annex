Thanks for the hint - this doesn't seem to make any difference though. If I unterstand the manpage correctly, adding files in locked form is the default anyway. I tried it to be sure:

    # git config --get annex.addunlocked
    false

and restarted the assistant. The behaviour is the same as before, files are added unlocked.
