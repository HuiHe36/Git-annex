The assistant adds files unlocked because it's intended to work for
unsophisticated users who would be confused to have the file they saved
suddenly turn into a symlink. For that matter, even a sophisticated user
might find reasons to be annoyed at that happening without them doing
anything.

While it could treat annex.addunlocked not being set to add files unlocked,
but honor if if it's set, it seems potentially confusing to make unset and
false have different meanings. Also if annex.addunlocked were set globally,
there would be no way to put it in the "unset" state in the local repo.
Maybe it would be better as a separate config setting for the assistant,
eg `annex.assistant.honor.addunlocked`

I do not think this will be very easy to implement, unfortunately.
