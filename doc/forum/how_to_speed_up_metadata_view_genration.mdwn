I personally really see the value in utilizing the [metadata driven views](https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/metadata_driven_views/), like for organizing which of my podcasts i have and have not listened to, or for tagging images and being able to filter off those tags.  However, my annex is very large and when i try to generate these views it takes several minutes just to generate a single view, which in most cases i come to find out that I typed the name of an included directory wrong and need to regenerate a different view.  Is there anyway for one to limit what files/directories the view generator scans through?  like if i wanted to show all the tags i have associated with my podcasts, then to limit that search to just my podcasts directory
