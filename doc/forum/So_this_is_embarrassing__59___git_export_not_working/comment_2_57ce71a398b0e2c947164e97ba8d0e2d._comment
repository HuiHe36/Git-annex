Oh, so in my haste to complete the task, I `rm -Rf *` the target directory, and when the files still didn't copy, and just ran `cp`. I don't know if I still have output to that effect, though. But I did have quite a few files with new names, so I was puzzled that those files were not copied because no files with those names or hashes had ever been exported to this annex remote.

I don't know if there is some local database or log of what git annex thinks is on a special remote that I can paste to demonstrate the discrepancy?

Thanks.
