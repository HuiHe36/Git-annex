Your use of `git-annex sync --no-content` doesn't make much sense,
of course that will not cause it to export any content because you told it
not to. Also there is configuration needed for git-annex sync to export
a branch to a remote and you have not shown that you performed such
configuration, and the output of the command seems to indicate you have
not.

Your `git annex export master --to film-depot` seems to have behaved
correctly, since the content of some files were not present it was not able
to export those. Running `git annex get` and then re-running that command
will make update the export with the missing files. I have tested that.
