Originally, it seemed to work and exported the files that I expected; What confused me is there were not in the directory on the export target.

So I went and recovered those files from another annex that had them, and re-ran the export. No errors.

But also, it didn't export the files that it couldn't find; It's like after the first failed attempt, that was it. Even with the files present, it did not export them.

So that's what led to the `rm -Rf` and finally the `cp`.

Maybe I can reset it all by reinitializing the export remote somehow?
