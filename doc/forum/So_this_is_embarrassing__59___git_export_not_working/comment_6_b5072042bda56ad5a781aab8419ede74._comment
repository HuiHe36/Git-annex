You can run `git annex fsck --from film-depot` and it will notice any files
that are somehow missing, and re-running the export will then upload those
missing files again.

I do not see any way that it could say it was exporting files to the remote
and then the files did not get stored there, but it reported success. It
seems most likely that you somehow deleted those files after the fact.
