Yes, once I saw those errors, I went back and did a `get annex copy --from <remote>` and recovered them. But what happened after that it seems I can't provide evidence of is running `git annex export ...` did not export the recovered files. It puzzlingly showed output that it was copying the files.

(The `git annex sync --no-content` was because I've gotten used to running that for other repos where not doing that will copy files into a repo where I intentionally need them dropped. In this case, the goal was just to make sure the git branches properly reflected any file adds, deletes, and renames.)

But on the target device, there was no evidence that the files were there. I ran an `ls` and they weren't present. I can't fathom why. But further attempts to export the files were unsuccessful. It seems you can't re-export files that already were copied. But they were nonetheless absent. I suppose this sounds fantastical, and somehow it is probably user error.

And this is the remote definition.

```
[remote \"film-depot\"]
	annex-directory = /Volumes/WDCGREEN/films
	annex-uuid = 59db1192-02ff-440a-86d4-xxxx
	skipFetchAll = true
	annex-ignore = false
```

In any case, I'd successfully done exports here in the past, and had the files appear at the destination. So I'm doing something wrong, somehow.

Can I just \"reset\" the export remote and start over again fresh?

Thanks.
