If you have already exported a file to a special remote, doing an export
again will skip that same file and not display anything[1]. So without you
showing me anything else, it looks like that is what the situation is, and
nothing is wrong. If you think something is wrong, you'll need to explain
in more detail what it is.

[1] Except sometimes for file that are checked into git and not git-annex, 
which explains why only .gitignore and README and such are displated.
