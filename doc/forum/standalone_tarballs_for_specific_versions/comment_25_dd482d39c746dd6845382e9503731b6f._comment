It would take a significant amount of extra work, on an ongoing basis, for
the version output by the standalone build to match the version used for
the release. I would need to, after making a release, go build git-annex
against that tag, on multiple OS's. It is much easier to simply have an
autobuilder that builds current master, and when I make a release, ship the
most recent build.

It's also some ongoing amount of work to respond to repeated
questions about it, when people notice that the version strings don't
perfectly match up, but I guess I've answered your questions about it now
and you won't be contributing to that workload further. Right?

(The third way I could reduce the workload, which does seem more appealing
for some reason right now, would be to stop offering release builds.)
