I'm trying to make git-annex work with the ipfs special remote here: (https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/ipfs/). Publishing to IPFS works, but I cannot retrieve the files onto another machine through git-annex

Running "git-annex copy --to ipfs" does copy files onto ipfs, I can access them through the CIDs (through an IPFS gateway like ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID>), and I can view the annexed files on running "git annex whereis"
But, "git annex whereis" on the other computer gives an empty output. (even after running git annex sync on both systems). "git annex copy --from ipfs" also gives no output on the other system.

Is there something obvious that I'm missing?
