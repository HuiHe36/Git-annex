Hello,

I have a repository that is set up to upload files to S3.

I am testing the idea of fetching files by doing the following

```
mkdir tmp

cd tmp

git clone git@github.com:MyUserName/MyRepo.git

git annex enableremote mys3

git annex get .

```

I get error messages such as:

```
get files/a-tutorial-on-the-universality-and-expressiveness-of-fold.pdf (not available)                                                                
  Maybe add some of these git remotes (git remote add ...):                
        942f7e73-262b-4850-8a2b-ccb7c0e5666d -- <ommitted>
                                                                                                                                                       
  (Note that these git remotes have annex-ignore set: origin)       
failed 
```

This happens even though the S3 environmental variables are properly set.

Thank you for your help! This program seems awesome - I just need to figure out how to use it.
