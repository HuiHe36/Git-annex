Using my M1 Air a lot more these days, not having git-annex is a pain. The Homebrew formula dependencies all have ARM bottles at this point, but building from source fails (criterion-measurement-0.1.2.0). Anyone with ideas on how to end up with a working Rosetta 2 setup? My previous experiments were a mess (see above), no doubt partly due to an environment where multiple versions of various components are conflicting with each other.
