Update: To me, this seems to be related to Apple's System Integrity Protection somehow, maybe related to the OS upgrade.

Manually whitelisting the entire contents of the application package under \"Full Disk Access\" seemed to help, at first. But then various commands were still a no-go, as per above. Perhaps because some of the tooling overlap with Homebrew etc.

Maybe if I was just using the webapp I could try again and reinstall everything, but as my needs are more specific I eventually gave up and will wait for proper support. Shouldn't be too far off now.
