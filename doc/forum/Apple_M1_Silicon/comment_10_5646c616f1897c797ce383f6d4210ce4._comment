Thanks, but it's still not working for me (tried twice):

    Last 15 lines from /Users/md/Library/Logs/Homebrew/git-annex/02.cabal:
    Currently only 10 to 12 is supported. System LLVM version: 12.0.0
    We will try though...

    You are using an unsupported version of LLVM!

    clang: error: unable to execute command: posix_spawn failed: Resource temporarily unavailable

    <no location info>: error:
    Error running clang! you need clang installed to use the LLVM backend
    (or GHC tried to execute clang incorrectly)
    `clang' failed in phase `Clang (Assembler)'. (Exit code: 1)

But perhaps a bottle is not that far away now.
