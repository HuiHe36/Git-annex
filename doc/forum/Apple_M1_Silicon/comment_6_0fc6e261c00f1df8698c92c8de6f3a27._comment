Seeing some strange things lately, I believe it started after updating to macOS 11.3. Some git annex commands work fine (like `git annex Ã dd` or copying to a remote), others (like `git annex sync`, the webapp) throw errors like this:

    git-annex(55965,0x2046f9e00) malloc: can't allocate region
    :*** mach_vm_map(size=1048576, flags: 100) failed (error code=268435465)
    git-annex(55965,0x2046f9e00) malloc: *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
    git-annex: git: createProcess: runInteractiveProcess: exec: resource exhausted (Cannot allocate memory)

I'm using `8.20210331-g1fb59a63a` from the .dmg provided here. I realize it's a bit of a hack setup so I haven't really investigated much yet, just wondering if someone knows what may be going on.
