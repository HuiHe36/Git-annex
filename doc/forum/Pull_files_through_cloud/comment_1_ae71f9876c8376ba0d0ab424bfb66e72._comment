A better solution is to use [metadata](https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-metadata/). You just tag the files you want in the cloud and for the cloud remote set a preferred-content expression like `metadata=tag=cloud`. And then I think you can just run the [git-annex-assistant] on the desktop and it'll automatically sync the files if metadata for a file changes.
