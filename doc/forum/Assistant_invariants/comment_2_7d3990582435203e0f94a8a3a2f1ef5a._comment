Ok, so I think I understand now where all of my problems come from.

On adding new content in `Desktop`, if some files are duplicates of already available content on `Laptop`, those will not be symlinks on `Laptop`.
When I dropped files from `Laptop`, the duplicate files in other folders, which I did not intend to drop, got also removed. I re-added them, and observed that the files I dropped came back again. Obviously, because they are the same duplicate files.

Very confusing behavior, at least until I understood how duplicate files are handled and the interaction with git annex drop/get + manual mode. Is there maybe some command that drops files from a folder, that **only exist in that folder**?
