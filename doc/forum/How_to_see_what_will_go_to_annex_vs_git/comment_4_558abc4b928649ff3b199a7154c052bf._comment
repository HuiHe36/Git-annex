Would you consider adding a command like this to `git-annex`? I almost always want to work with untracked files at first, which means using `git add` to add them (because `git-annex` doesn't have an `--unlocked` option afaik). Adding them to git by mistake is not good. And really it's just helpful to know when I have new files, are they going to git or to annex.
