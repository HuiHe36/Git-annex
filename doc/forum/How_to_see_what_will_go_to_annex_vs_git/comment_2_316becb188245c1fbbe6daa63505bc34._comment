Good solution. And if it somehow added a file to annex that you want in git
you can `git annex unannex` easily enough.

There is not any way to query without adding, query commands like
`git-annex find` only operate on annexed files so it would need to be
a new mode added to the command. Or I suppose `git annex add --dry-run`
could be made to, but don't know that I really like the idea. I like
your solution better than these ideas though.
