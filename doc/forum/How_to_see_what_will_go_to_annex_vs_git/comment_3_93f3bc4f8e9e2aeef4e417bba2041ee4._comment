`git annex add --dry-run` is actually the first thing I tried :)

I came across `git-annex-matchexpression` and was able to put together [this script](https://gist.github.com/patmaddox/61ddf773f7b65bd2b42cee7f4e5e574d) that neatly shows me what untracked files will go where:

```
% ./bin/whereto.rb
files to annex:
	- projects/chicken/hello.wav

files to git:
	- bin/whereto.rb
	- projects/chicken/bar
	- projects/chicken/foo

annex.largefiles:
	include=*.dorico or include=*.mp3 or include=*.pdf or include=*.mxl or include=*.mscz or include=*.xml or include=*.RPP or include=*.wav or include=*.aif*
```
