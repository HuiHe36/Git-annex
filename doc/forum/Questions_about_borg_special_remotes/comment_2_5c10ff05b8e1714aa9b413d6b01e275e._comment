Well, that certainly explains it. Not only that, it makes perfect sense. The borg repo in question has about a hundred archives so I soon grew tired. ```BORG_PASSPHRASE``` seems obvious in retrospect, of course the GUI does that for me in my day-to-day use.

Trying to use some of the really clever combinations on offer is challenging to a novice user. I sometimes feel like my ambition is to be a half-decent conductor, only I'm periodically also expected to step down and tune the harpsichord. Mind you, this isn't criticism â€“ it's one of the principles that makes git-annex so great. borg is a solo performer, adding it to the ensemble is my choice and making it blend well with the rest of the instruments is up to me.

On third, careful look, I don't believe there's any error on the tips page.

Thanks!
