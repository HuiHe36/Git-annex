If you want to completely narrow down a commit, use `git bisect`
between 4262ba3c4 and 5e5829a8d. With 400 commits in that range it should
take less than 9 rebuilds.

Do you have annex.retry or similar config set? That range includes a change
that spins up a bunch of child git-annex processes when that is set,
which seems like the kind of thing that could be relevant.

Since git cat-file is usually started up once and left running for the
lifetime of git-annex (and waited for at the end if it exits normally),
it's hard to see how it could end up being run repeatedly otherwise.
