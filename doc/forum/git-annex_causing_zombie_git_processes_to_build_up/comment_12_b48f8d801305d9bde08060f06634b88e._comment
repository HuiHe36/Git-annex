I found a case where zombie git processes could be started in theory, 
but only when git-annex is run without -J. And only a few zombies I think.
And I couldn't find a code path where it actually happened.
So not the same as this bug. But it did involve setConcurrency, which 
the bisected commit also involves (via forkState), so at least shows
how that could cause a such a problem in theory. Fixed that.
