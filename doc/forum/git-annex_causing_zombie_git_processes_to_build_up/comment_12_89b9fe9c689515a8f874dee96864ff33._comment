Reproduced the bug. Took laptop entirely offline, then `git-annex get -J5`
in the repo @yoh provided above. Sometimes it happens immediately,
sometimes it needs to wait a few minutes for DNS timeouts.

Looks like one leaked git cat-file per time it failed to download in that
situation.

Should be able to take it from here..
