I have not managed to reproduce it using that script. I let it run for 5
minutes (and 1 gb transferred).

Since that commit points to stall detection, I hacked the code to
constantly detect false stalls. But I am still not seeing any zombie git
processes with that.

If stall detection *is* involved, I'd expect that you would see
"Transfer seems to have stalled" when reproducing the bug.

Since stall detection could depend on available bandwidth etc, I wonder if
the script reproduces the bug reliably enough for the bisection to be
correct. It would be helpful to manually verify the bisection result,
with a longer test period than the script used. And look for the above
message when reproducing it.
