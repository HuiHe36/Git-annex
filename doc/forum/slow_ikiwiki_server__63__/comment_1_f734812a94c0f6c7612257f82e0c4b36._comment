Ikiwiki slows down the more files there are, so removing old
closed bug reports and comments on them periodically is mostly how this is
dealt with. I've deleted ones from before 2020, which shrank the number of
files by 10%.

It's worth noting that 1/3 of the remaining files are in this forum,
more than the remaining bugs+todos. Of course splitting it is an option,
but I wonder how useful 10 year old posts in it actually are..
