Try nix-on-droid. It also uses proot (for everything actually) but Nix has an entirely different linking model to traditional distributions.

Just open `nix-shell -p git git-annex` or add those two to your `environment.packages` in `~/.config/nixpkgs/nix-on-droid.nix` and then `nix-on-droid switch`. (Using `nix-env` is also possible but I wouldn't recommend it.)
