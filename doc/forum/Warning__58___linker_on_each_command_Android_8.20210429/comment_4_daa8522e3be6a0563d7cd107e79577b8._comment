I have the same issue.

@joey Does 'shipped' mean only upon git-annex installation on termux or each time I run a command? 
Because I do get this warning several times during runtime, each time I run a git annex command.

It helps to pinpoint the error to proot, but on their [git](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro) they talk about this warning occurring only during installation, not several time during use. 

I tried:
1. installing proot specifically in termux with `pkg install proot-distro`: -> installed two new packages, but warning still there
2. new git annex install on termux:
    - `$ pkg up`
    - `$ source git-annex-install`
    - saw the aforementioned linker warning once
    - when e.g. using `$ git annex sync origin` the warning still shows up 

Next steps to try:
1. new termux install on android
2. try older termux version 

Any other tips/ideas how to fix this?
