FYI I raised an issue over on [termux-proot-github](https://github.com/termux/proot-distro/issues/201) some suggested to run proot in isolated mode. But I dont know how to do that using git annex, since in cli I never acutually come in contact with the `proot` commands. But maybe that give some more inside.
