@Atemu great tip! I had seen nix-on-droid and wondered about it.

I have added some instructions based on your comment
to [[/Android]].

Looks like `git-annex webapp` does not work in nix-on-droid,
because it cannot open a web page. Perhaps there is some way to
do that; on termux git-annex uses xdg-open, but I tried it on nix-on-droid
and it does not work. For now I documented nix-on-droid as an alternative
for users who want to use git-annex at the command line.
