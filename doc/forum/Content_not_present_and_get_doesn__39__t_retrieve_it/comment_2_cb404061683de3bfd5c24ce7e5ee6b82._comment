Hi, thanks! That was just what I was looking for.  I haven't had to use that command before but it looks pretty useful.  I ended up running on the entire annex and found files that needed \"fixing\" I wasn't even aware of. Do you recommend periodically running this just to make sure everything checks out, or should I only run it when I discover a problem?  

For some of the files, it claims that no known copies exist and there is not .git/annex/bad directory.  Is that game over for those files? (Only a handful, so not the end of the world, but would be nice to recover them.)
