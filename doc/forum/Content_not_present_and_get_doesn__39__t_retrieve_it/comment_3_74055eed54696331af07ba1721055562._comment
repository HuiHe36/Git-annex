You should not need to fsck regularly. The question is, what happened to
make those files that git-annex thinks are present go missing. One
possible way would be if there was an actual data corruption of files on
the drive.

`git-annex fsck` only mentions `.git/annex/bad/` when it discovers that a
file's content on disk has gotten corrupted. It then moves it to that
directory, and mentions that it has. So this makes me think your drive must
have data corruption. This is only a guess, since you unfortunately did not
paste the output, like I asked for..
