So both are setting the "filter" attribute. And trying 
`git check-attr filter my_secret` it outputs "git-crypt"
with the configuration you show, but with git-annex's .git/info/attributes,
it outputs "annex".

       When deciding what attributes are assigned to a path, Git consults
       $GIT_DIR/info/attributes file (which has the highest precedence),
       .gitattributes file in the same directory as the path in question, and
       its parent directories up to the toplevel of the work tree (the further
       the directory that contains .gitattributes is from the path in
       question, the lower its precedence). Finally global and system-wide
       files are considered (they have the lowest precedence).

So by "highest precedence" it means it stops when it finds the attribute
in that file. Unfortunate, but I kind of see why they would do that,
since .git/info/attributes is a way to locally override .gitattributes
files in the repo.

git-annex could write to .gitattributes, but it feels cleaner to not
need to modify the contents of the git repo in order to use the
current version of git-annex with it.
