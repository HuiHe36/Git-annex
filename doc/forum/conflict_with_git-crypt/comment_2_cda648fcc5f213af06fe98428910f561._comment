Thank you for your explanation! 

Removing `* filter=annex` altogether causes problems when the repo has unlocked files, but removing it from `.git/info/attributes` and adding a `.gitattributes` file with the following contents at the repository root seems to allow both git-crypt and git-annex to work without issue:

```
* filter=annex
my_secret filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
```
