Well that message suggests that the CID of the file appears to have
changed. But I investigated the changed CID theory back in comment #4 and
could not get it to produce an empty commit.

The file being not annexed might be a clue.

If it happens with a symlink, that would certianly be a clue. But
git-annex avoids exporting symlinks to special remotes now, so it would be
worth upgrading to the most recent release to avoid the old behavior with
them.
