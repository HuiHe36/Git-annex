I guess you mean commits like "import from foo",
or perhaps "remote tracking branch". Not adb-specific at all.

The "remote tracking branch" commits are merge commits, so cannot be
avoided, even though they don't make any apparent changes.

It mostly does manage to avoid making the "import from" commits
when there is no difference from the previous commit.
The only case I know of where it does not is in the initial import,
if the branch was exported first, and then imported. I see an empty 
"import from" then. Subsequent imports, when there are no changes to the
tree, do not make a new commit.

Of course, you can rebase out any of these commits if you want to.
