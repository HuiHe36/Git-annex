Well, a change to the inode would change the CID, but what I saw back in
comment #4 was that a change to the CID when the file content did not
actually change, did not result in an empty commit. So I still don't
understand how you are getting empty commits here.

I also don't think all android devices do that, because such a change of
the inode will mean it needs to re-download the file, and I do not see
periodic re-downloads of files when syncing with my own android phone.
