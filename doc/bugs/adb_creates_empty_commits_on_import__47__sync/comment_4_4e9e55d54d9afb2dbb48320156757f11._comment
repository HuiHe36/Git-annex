> Now, if Android is varying the mtime it reports for files [...]

I do not think this idea of mine can cause it. I tried, using a directory
special remote, touching a file in the remote after having already imported
it once. This resulted in git-annex sync importing the same file again, but
since the content was the same it built the same tree it had before, and
noticed this and avoided making an empty commit.

On the merge commits, importing creates one, and exporting creates one.
So sync creates two. Also, if you export and then merge the remote tracking
branch (a fast-forward merge), and then export again, 
it makes another merge commit. So any number can be stacked up that way.

See [[!commit 1503b86a14865ce300ebb9c4d96315eeb254d0b8]]
(and subsequent [[!commit 2bd0e07ed83db39907f0c824854d68c1a8ba77ac]]
and [[!commit a32f31235a67d572d989ad9e344efe11d78774a5]] where this was
introduced. This stuff makes my head hurt, and getting it wrong leads to
broken merges from the remote tracking branch...
