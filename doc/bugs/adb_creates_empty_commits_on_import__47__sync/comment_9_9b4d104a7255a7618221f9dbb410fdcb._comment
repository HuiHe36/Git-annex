@joey I had found out the root cause of the bug !
CID really changes between different days.

Basically, on android /sdcard internal user memory (and /storage/* mounted SDCard) are not exposed directly, but through virtual flash driver.
And this driver REGULARLY increments inode for ALL files in FS, around once per day on average (but I spotted once per several days, and several times a day too).
For example same file had 3 different inodes over the week: 323733 -> 338757 -> 364584 -> ... -> 426292.
I dunno why it rotates regularly or after some events -- but truth is *inode is not reliable* as CID on android.

In that case -- can we change CID for android remote to (mtime, name) only?
