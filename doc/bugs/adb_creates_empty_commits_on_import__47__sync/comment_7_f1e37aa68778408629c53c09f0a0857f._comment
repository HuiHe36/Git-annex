I somewhat narrowed down the issue.
Error \"unsafe to overwrite file\" only appears for plaint text files (and symlinks) committed to .git itself.
This error only appears after several exports and some time passes (still can't catch conditions).

Current hypothesis is that empty commits in history are related to these plain text files.
@joey, do you have any thoughts?
