I tried making a borg repo with 100 archives of a 1000 object git-annex
repo. The length of each item was 142 bytes, so all the items should
need about 15 mb of memory. git-annex sync used more than 2 gb
of memory. So that's a test case for this bug.

Looks like around 500 mb is used listing the repo contents, and
then after all the borg list is complete, it uses much more memory
building the git tree.

I was not including building the git tree in my estimates. I see
that Annex.Import uses recordTree, which does have to buffer the whole
tree in memory, but this seems much more memory than that.
