I'd expect the amount of memory git-annex uses to increase with the number
of archives in the borg repo that contain a git-annex repository. So I am
curious how many such archives there are in your borg repo.

The memory use also scales with the number of annex object files in the git-annex
repository. So I'm curious how many such files there are in one of the
borg archives.

If there are say, 1000 archives of a git-annex repository that
contains 1000 annex objects, that's a million items. I'd estimate a couple
hundred megabytes memory for for that. The length of the path to the
git-annex repository and the archive name are included in each item, so more
when those are long.

If it could only include one item for each git-annex key, that would avoid
needing so much memory. But I don't think it can, because an archive can
be deleted, and if the one item it included was in the deleted archive,
it would not be able to retrieve the object from other archives that still
exists, without a rescan.
