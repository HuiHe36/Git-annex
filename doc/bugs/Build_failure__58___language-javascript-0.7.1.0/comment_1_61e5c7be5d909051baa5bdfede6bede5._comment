Here is an upstream bug report about the same problem, 
<https://github.com/erikd/language-javascript/issues/86>

Unfortunately the author of language-javascript has decided to not support
building it except in a unicode locale. So you will need to set
LANG or similar to a unicode locale to avoid the problem.

I don't see anything I can do about this in git-annex, this is not a direct
dependency and it is uncreasingly unusual for users to not use a unicode
locale, so while I would rather compilers (and everything else) did not crash
in these situations, I expect that anyone not using a unicode locale is
going to see lots of problems like this in the future.
