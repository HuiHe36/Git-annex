It seems that somehow it is failing to set environment variables. Eg,
`GIT_INDEX_FILE` is what makes git use `.git/annex/index` and if it was not
set it would behave as you describe.

This strongly suggests that there is a bug in the compiler/libraries.

Here is a small test program:

	import System.Environment
	import System.Process
	
	main = do
		let p = (proc "sh" ["-c", "echo testing: $TEST"])
		let p' = p { env = Just [("TEST", "foo")] } 
		withCreateProcess p' $ \_ _ _ pid -> waitForProcess pid
		setEnv "TEST" "bar"
		withCreateProcess p $ \_ _ _ pid -> waitForProcess pid

If run with "runghc foo.hs", that should output "testing: foo" and then 
"testing: bar".
