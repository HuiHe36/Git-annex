Ilya, you have misunderstood what I said. The autobuild happened. I
then updated the changelog, made one other commit that didn't affect
the code, and tagged the release. I could then either wait for the next
autobuild, or I could ship what was in the last autobuild. I did the
latter, for the reasons described in comment #1.

If this is not clear, my advice would be you either review the code that I
use for builds and releases, which is all public, until you understand it,
or you don't use my builds. I tire of this.
