6e67ea5d7 is 2 commits away from the tag for 8.20210803. 
The two commits are whitespace changes and the commit that increased the
version number.

I can either push the release to git and bless the builds current at the
same time, or wait some amount of time after the release tag for the builds
to catch up. That could be some arbitrary amount of time, because builds
fail for various reasons outside my control, or are slow.

It would also need a separate build process than the autobuilds of master,
to build against release tags. Which adds even more ways for things to go
wrong or be delayed.

Therefore, I have chosen this compromise. It is not new, and if you
consider it a bug, well, you can build against the release tag if you wish.
