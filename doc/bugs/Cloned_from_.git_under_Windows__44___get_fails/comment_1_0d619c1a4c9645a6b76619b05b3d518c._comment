I can reproduce this on linux.

It's getting confused by a url pointing to a git directory that has
core.bare=false.

git-annex's RepoLocation data type does not have a way to represent
this situation, and it would complicate it significantly to do so.

I do not see any good reason to use a non-bare git directory as if it is a
bare repository. Not good enough for me to spend days complicating
git-annex's code for anyway.
