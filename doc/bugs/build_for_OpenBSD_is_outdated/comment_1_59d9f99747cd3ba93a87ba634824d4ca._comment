You will need to get in touch with the OpenBSD maintainers to get them to
update the package. Nothing that filing a bug here can do about it.

Unless there is some problem with the git-annex code that is preventing
them from building a newer version of course.

ghc 8.10 is not old at all, it's a commonly used version, and the version of
cabal is also recent enough. git-annex should build with those versions.
