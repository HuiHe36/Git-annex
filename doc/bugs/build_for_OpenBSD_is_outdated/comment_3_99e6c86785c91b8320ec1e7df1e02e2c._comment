This is not the place to file bug reports about a distribution of git-annex
by eg OpenBSD or a Linux distribution being out of date. In the future,
file the bug with the distributor, which is where the changes need to
happen to update it.

The exception, of course, is if something about git-annex is preventing the
distributor from upgrading it.
