I've applied the patch to git-annex to qualify the export.

That failing test is an unrelated and now fixed bug.

I can't do much more about the dependencies needing updates. Aside from
maintaining them myself, which I kind of have been with aws to an extent,
but not enough to be able to cut a new release with the fix.
