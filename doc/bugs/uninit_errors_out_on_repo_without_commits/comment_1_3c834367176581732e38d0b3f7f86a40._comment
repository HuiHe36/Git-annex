It seems that not only does your repository not
have any commits in master, it also lacks a git-annex branch.

Since `git-annex init` creates the git-annex branch, and git will
refuse to clone a repo with no master branch, I don't know how you
could have gotten a repo in this state. 
(Aside from manually deleting the branch first.)

With a git-annex branch, I see only the unknown HEAD warning,
but it does succeed.
