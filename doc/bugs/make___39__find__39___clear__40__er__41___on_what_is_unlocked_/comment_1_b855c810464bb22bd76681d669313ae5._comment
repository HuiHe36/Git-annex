The only difference between those two is that git-annex unlock stages the
unlocking, while replacing the file with unlocked content does not stage
it yet.

Both files are unlocked in the working tree though. One is unlocked in
the index, and the other one is not yet. But git-annex find examines the
working tree.

What you are looking for is a a way to have `git-annex find`
ignore the working tree and find files that are unlocked in the index.
That is doable:

	git-annex find --branch=$(git write-tree) --unlocked
