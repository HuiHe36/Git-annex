The assistant's git-annex repair sometimes happens when git fsck does not
actually detect any problems.

See [[Git_repos_corrupt_themselves]] of which this was part of the cause,
although the data loss part of that was solved.

I saw this happen on my sister's laptop, in a freshly cloned repo,
with a git-annex version that fixed that data loss.
assistant was set up to fsck and on the very first fsck it started git
repair. git fsck reported no problems at all. --[[Joey]]
