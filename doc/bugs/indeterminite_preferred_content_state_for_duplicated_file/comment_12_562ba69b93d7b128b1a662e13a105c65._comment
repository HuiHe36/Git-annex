This is about ready to be merged, and is fully working.

Except.. `git annex drop --auto --branch=foo` seems likely to do something
confusing, since it will check the associated files, which may not be on
that branch. That combination of options doesn't really make a lot of sense
anyway? Also consider `git-annex drop --all --auto`

Ahh, not a problem after all, that option combo is already disallowed!
