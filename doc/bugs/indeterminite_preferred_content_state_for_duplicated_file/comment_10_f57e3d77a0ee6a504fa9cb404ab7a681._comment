There must also be the same problem for required content, and that should
also be fixed. Will be easy to do once the information is gathered
into the keys database.

Actually, in the drop --auto case, required content is automatically
handled correctly, because when checking preferred content it also checks
required content.

However, drop without --auto normally honors required content, but if the
same content is used by 2 files, one required and the other not, dropping
the latter file will drop the content of the first, violating required
content settings. This seems like it ought to be fixed.
