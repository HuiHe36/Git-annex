By "currently checked out branch", I meant in the repository where
git-annex is running. It might be copying to a special remote or whatever,
but the filename matched by include= or exclude= in a preferred content
expression comes from the branch it's run in.

When run in a bare git repo (or with --all), include= and exclude= are
documented not to match.
