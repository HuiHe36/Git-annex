Thanks @joeyh for working on this.

Is the following understanding of preferred content expressions accurate:

* the expression is a predicate on file paths, not on keys.   Expressions that check the property of a key (e.g. numcopies) are evaluated for each file path on the key it uses.
* a given key is wanted in a repo if the preferred content expression is true for *any* file path which uses the key

Also, if the above if correct, is \"any file path which uses the key\" defined the same way as in [[git-annex-unused]]?
