Probably skipping symlinks for both import/export is for the best.

My personal expectations (pipe dream?) are to export symlinks as real files -- but only compare during import and warn if different.

Because if I see file/symlink in some repo -- it's placed there for a reason, and after sync I expect to find all the expected files in their folders (even if through multiple copies). 
Silently ignoring of symlinks forces me to remember to check that whatever I want to sync does not contain them.
Otherwise I may be in a very delicate situation, if files needed for work were not synced to phone and I have no access to PC at that moment ;)

On the other hand, I remember literally months I spent debugging and configuring samba, and reading their history of symlinks implementations.
It contains so much frustrating corner cases, that banning symlinks completely isn't a bad idea, actually.
