(Sorry, command used on the more powerful machine was `git annex add`, not `fsck`.)

The read speed here (~320MiB/s) is pretty close to the `openssl speed sha256` result for 16B block size (~360MiB/s) or 64B blocks with SHA256 acceleration disabled (~300MiB/s, `OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x20000000`).

What block size is used here and does git-annex use SHA instructions for hashing?
