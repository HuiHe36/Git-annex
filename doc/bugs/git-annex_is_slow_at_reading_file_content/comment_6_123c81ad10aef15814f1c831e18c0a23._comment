Awesome that you were able to reproduce it in cryptonite and file that. 
Thank you!

I'm inclined to close this, because it seems unlikely there will be a fix
for it in git-annex. One fix that would be possible here is for
git-annex to use the exteneral sha256sum command. But, that would prevent
git-annex from displaying progress while hashing, which is why it moved
away from it in the first place.

Of course, you could also try using a different kind of hash that is
faster for new content.
