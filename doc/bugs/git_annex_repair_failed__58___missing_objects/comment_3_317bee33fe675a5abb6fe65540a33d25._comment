Thank you, your "Reproducible Example" worked for me to reproduce it!
Great work finding this and tracking down an easy way to reproduce it.

So the root of the problem is refs/annex/last-index,
which contains a tree object, not a commit object. That is unusual for a ref,
but git-annex has a good reason to record a tree's ref there. 

Fixed
