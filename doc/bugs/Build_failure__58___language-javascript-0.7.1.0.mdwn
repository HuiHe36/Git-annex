### Please describe the problem.

Building the latest version from source, whatever method I use eventually fails on the language-javascript-0.7.1.0 dependency. The error (stack output):

language-javascript              > Configuring language-javascript-0.7.1.0...
language-javascript              > build
language-javascript              > Preprocessing library for language-javascript-0.7.1.0..
language-javascript              > happy: src/Language/JavaScript/Parser/Grammar7.y: hGetContents: invalid argument (invalid byte sequence)
unordered-containers             > [6 of 9] Compiling Data.HashSet.Internal

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. Install ghc 8.10.7 via ghcup
2. Check out latest source
3. Issue any of the supported build commands, watch the failure eventually happen

### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes, it's wonderful.
