But you would have the same problem with that workflow if you were
checking the files into a git repository not using git-annex, 
and pulling from that repository. 

For that metter, you would have the same problem with that workflow if
you were running `git-annex add` and using `git-annex get`
to transfer over a ssh connection.

The mere fact that it might be possible to support that particular workflow
with adb or some other type of remote does not mean that it's a bug for
git-annex not to support it. Or that it's a good idea to complicate
git-annex to partially support it.

> And when you annex files -- git-annex copies file own mtime to its symlink

That's entirely different. When you run `git add` on a file, the file's
mtime is left unchanged. It follows that, when you `git-annex add` a file,
the mtime of the file (now a symlink) should also be unchanged. That's
entirely unrelated to remotes.
