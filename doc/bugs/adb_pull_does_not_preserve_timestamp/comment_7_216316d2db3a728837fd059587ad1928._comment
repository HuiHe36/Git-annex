@joey can we change android remote to use \"pull -a\" at least \"for now\"?

Let's try doing it in Linux Kernel or ZeroMQ way: enable/disable feature and wait for new bugreports.
And if new bugreports were critical -- revert feature back.
After all we can't predict everything from the get go.

I wish to preserve file original mtime (date of download) at least \"somewhere\" (e.g. manually dump find/CID into textual file).
But doing \"annex pull\" from android remote loses this information completely.
And this feature is critical for me -- unless some evidence will appear that having this feature more detrimental than not.

Concerns about SUID and other permissions are ungrounded, 
because Android virtual driver for /sdcard uses only 644/755 by design.
But instead of speculating -- we may simply wait for new bugreports.

@joey, what do you say? 
Let's experiment and gather results from wider audience?
