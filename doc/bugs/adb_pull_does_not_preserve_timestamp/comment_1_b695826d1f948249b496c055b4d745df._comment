Git does not preserve timestamps. So this is kind of out of scope.

While git-annex will sometimes preserve timestamps when it's easy to do so,
there are no guarantees. Most special remotes do not preserve any
timestamps in either direction.

It might be that `adb pull -a` would fix this. But that also preserves
the permissions, and pulling in random permissions for annex object files
could lead to arbitrary breakage (imagine a suid executable for example).
So it would need to clear the permissions. The complexity does not seem
worth trying to support a thing that is generally out of scope.
