The difference in behavior, when there's a conflict between a directory and a 
file, is that the recursive strategy leaves the directory in "added by them"
conflict state, as well as adding the file with a different name
(and oddly, not staging it at all), while
the ort strategy leaves does not flag the directory as in conflict,
and makes the file be in "added by them" conflict state.

`git-annex sync` resolves such a conflict adequately, with the new version
of git, but the name of the file turns out different, eg 
"foo~refs_remotes_origin_master.variant-b66a"
or "foo~HEAD.variant-b66a" rather than
"foo.variant-b66a". That happens only in such a mixed conflict,
a conflict between two annexed files still gets the shorter name
like "foo.variant-b66a".

There's a small problem with a lack of a stable name being used, as shown
above the name of the branch being merged from or to is used by git as part
of the filename. So two people who resolve a merge this way would end up
with two different names for the file. git-annex's merge conflict
resolution is designed to yield a stable result no matter where it's run,
so this behavior is a bit of a shame, but it's git's decision to behave
that way, and I guess the same thing can happen when not using git-annex,
if you commit what the new resolver stages. So this can be considered not a
git-annex problem.

I've adjusted the mixed conflict resolution test to accept these new names
while also still working with the old names. That fixes that one. The other
test is still failing.
