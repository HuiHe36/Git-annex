Currently the assistant simply tries to drop when it thinks it's possible
that the content may be droppable. It doesn't check if the drop is allowed
before trying to drop. Because that would be redundant with the check
that's done when actually dropping.

I don't see anything dangerous about this, same as running `git annex drop`
on lots of files and having them be preserved by numcopies is not
dangerous.

If it's a bug at all, it's only that it should be silent if
it is unable to perform the drop due to numcopies. However, 
making it silent about that also seems like it would make it harder to
figure out what is preventing things from being dropping in situations
where you do expect drops to happen.

As in, ironically, your specific case! You have a transfer remote, which is
having files pile up on it, despite them apparently having been transferred
from it to both of the repos you want it to transfer them to. Since your
local repo cannot access the other repo, it cannot verify it has the
content and so leaves a copy on the transfer remote.

If you had a problem with that transfer remote filling up, and nothing was
ever logged about why it was not dropping from it, it would be hard to
understand what was going on and how to fix it (eg by trusting the other
repo, or adding it as a remote, or lowering numcopies to 1).

So the logging seems like a good thing to me.
