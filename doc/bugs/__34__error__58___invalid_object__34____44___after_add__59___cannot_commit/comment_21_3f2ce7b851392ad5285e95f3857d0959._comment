This seems to be a not entirely uncommon git failure.
[google search](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=git+error%3A+invalid+object+100644+)
has tens of thousands of hits that look like this and do not involve
git-annex.

One commenter in <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14448326/git-commit-stopped-working-error-building-trees>
said it was a permissions problem.

Disconnecting a drive before all of git's changes have been written to it
seem like the other likely way.
