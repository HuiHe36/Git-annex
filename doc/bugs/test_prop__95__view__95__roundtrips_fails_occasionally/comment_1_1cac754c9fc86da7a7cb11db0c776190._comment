I fixed the other, similar bug shortly after you filed it. Please do file
bug reports for intermittent test suite breakage like this.

This does not reproduce on linux with --quickcheck-replay=258328, it's
windows specific. I can reproduce it by subbing in the windows filepath
modules on linux.

Simplified:

	ghci> let f = AssociatedFile (Just "foo\\X:l")
	ghci> let m = MetaData (fromList [(MetaField "H",S.fromList [MetaValue (CurrentlySet True) ">"]),(MetaField "HJ",S.fromList [MetaValue (CurrentlySet True) "a"]),(MetaField "m",S.fromList [MetaValue (CurrentlySet True) "#"]),(MetaField "ub",S.fromList [MetaValue (CurrentlySet True) "9"])])
	ghci> prop_view_roundtrips f m True
	False

Looks like viewedFileFromReference of that filename produces "X:l_%\\\\%",
which won't work because that looks like a drive letter.

This can't occur in real life, because "X:l" can't be the name of a file
in a directory "foo".

Fixed.
