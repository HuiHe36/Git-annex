Fixed by avoiding sync calling inAnnex when it knows it has the content,
because it just got it.

This does leave open the possibility that there are similar situations
elsewhere, that lead to either extra work like this, or to incorrect
behavior. Since sqlite write followed by a read is generally something
git-annex is careful of, and also since it is generally careful to have
reasonable behavior is sqlite somehow loses data, I'm not too worried about
incorrect behavior. I feel comfortable closing this bug with just this fix,
despite not getting to the bottom of the issue of why sqlite writes are
not immediately able to be read back on NTFS.
