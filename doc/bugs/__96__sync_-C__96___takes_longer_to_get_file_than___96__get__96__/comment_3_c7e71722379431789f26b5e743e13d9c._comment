Joey, would you be interested in taking a look at my minimal test case if I could send you the repo somehow?
I could just forcefully `drop` the last sensitive file in the annex and add an innocuous, say 100MB random file,
into the annex instead and then zip the repo up (with 7z or fsarchiver) and send it to you (by whatever means)
if that would be fine with you, perhaps? I know this an odd corner case but I would be definitely grateful if
you could oblige this hell-bent Windows user here. :)
