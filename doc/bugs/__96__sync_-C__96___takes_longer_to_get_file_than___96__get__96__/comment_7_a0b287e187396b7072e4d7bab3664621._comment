I've received the sample repo, and can reproduce the problem using its
script. (After changing a /bin/time to not hardcode the wrong path.)

	get 9BEAE03792B9FAFB-01-01--partial.dat.age (from origin...) 
	ok                                   
	(recording state in git...)
	* Number of read(2) file operations of annex object during `get` sub-command: 3205
	
	* op: sync -C
	
	drop 9BEAE03792B9FAFB-01-01--partial.dat.age ok
	(recording state in git...)
	get 9BEAE03792B9FAFB-01-01--partial.dat.age (from origin...) 
	ok                                   
	(recording state in git...)
	(recording state in git...)
	* Number of read(2) file operations of annex object during `sync -C` sub-command: 6410

Should be possible to track down the extra work from here.

(Sample repo stored in my big annex as
`git-annex-test-repos/Reflect-varmistukset-test@issue.tar`.
Mail with details of how to use it is

Note that NTFS filesystem needs to be 1.5 gb or larger in size.)
