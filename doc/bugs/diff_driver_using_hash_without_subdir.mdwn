### Please describe the problem.
I have a strange problem with diff driver.
I wrote a diff driver which normally works, but one of my repo
it comes up with an error that it can open `.git/annex/objects/SHA256E-s4545--9715...`.
Indeed there is no such file, the file being not directly under `.git/annex/objects` but under `.git/annex/objects/mz/Px`.
Also when I examine the file in git its value is `.git/annex/objects/SHA256E-s4545--9715...` but I thought it should have been `.git/annex/objects/mz/PX/SHA256E-s4545--9715...`.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Just use `git diff HEAD` on my corrupted repo.


### What version of git-annex are you using? On what operating system?

Version 7. I don't remember which version was used to create the repo.


### Please provide any additional information below.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
Yes and it works really well (and my diff driver works on other repos too).
