Ok, you've ruled out my theory about -T, and stdin is being connected up
through ssh correctly it looks like.

One other thing to try would be to enable ssh verbose debugging,
by running: `git config annex.ssh-options "-v -v -v"`  
And perhaps that will give a clue.

But I think the signs are pointing to you needing to change something
about your ssh installation on Windows. Perhaps a different version of ssh
for Windows would support the GUI password prompt. Normally, ssh comes
from Git for Windows, which bundles a ssh, and I think that one does
support the GUI prompt. Do you have some other ssh build installed?
