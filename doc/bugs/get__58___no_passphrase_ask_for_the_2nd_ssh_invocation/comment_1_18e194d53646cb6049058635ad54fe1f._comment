I do not think that git-annex is doing anything there that prevents ssh
from asking for a password. Ie, it's not setting BatchMode=true,
which it does do when it wants to prevent ssh from prompting for a
password. That is done only when ssh connection caching is supported,
which it's not on Windows.

It's running `ssh git@gin.g-node.org -T "git-annex-shell 'p2pstdio' '/yarikoptic/test-annex' '--debug' 'dfff8737-36e2-4a1c-8206-bca071a5294d' --uuid 2a0fa804-1bd6-4298-aa55-4dc2d250eeac"`
and that somehow fails, and the failure is at the ssh level (ssh exit status
255 means a ssh error). This might not involve a password at all. For
whatever reason ssh is failing without displaying any error message.

It could be something as simple as this ssh not supporting -T. Or 
just being broken in whatever way ssh on windows might be broken.

My suggestion is, run the ssh command yourself, and see if it exits
255, if so proceed to debugging ssh..
