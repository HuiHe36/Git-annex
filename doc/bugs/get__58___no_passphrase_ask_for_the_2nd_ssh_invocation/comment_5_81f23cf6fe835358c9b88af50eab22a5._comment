What is the exit status of ssh when you run that?

That would normally print out the AUTH-SUCCESS and block waiting for input
from stdin.  Your transcript seems to show it closing immediately after that
output, unless perhaps you sent it a ctrl-d.

So perhaps stdin is not getting connected through the `ssh -T`,
or something could be failing on the remote end.
