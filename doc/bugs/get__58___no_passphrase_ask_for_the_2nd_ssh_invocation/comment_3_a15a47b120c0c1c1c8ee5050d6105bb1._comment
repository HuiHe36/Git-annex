That does not help diagnose your problem, does it? All is says is that the
problem somehow involves password protected ssh keys. But ssh is what deals
with those.

You have to show that the problem is actually caused by git-annex, not by ssh,
before I can really do anything about it. The obvious way to do that is
to run the command as I suggested.
