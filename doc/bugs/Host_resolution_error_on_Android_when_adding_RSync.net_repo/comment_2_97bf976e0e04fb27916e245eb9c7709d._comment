This is not limited to rsync.net, other DNS lookups by git-annex also fail.

Without investigating, my strong hunch is that this is because git-annex is
linked to glibc, and so it expects there to be /etc/nssswitch.conf,
/etc/resolv.conf, /etc/services etc that glibc uses. And
some/all of those files are not present on Android. If you were able to set
up the files, it would probably work.
