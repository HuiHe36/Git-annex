I do not think you need to reach for receive.denyCurrentBranch
to explain this behavior. The assistant runs git merge itself,
and is watching for changes to the working tree at the same time. 
So it can get notifications of changes, that are made by git merge,
and commit them. 

The result is that basically, any change that gets made to the work tree
while the assistant is running, can end up being recorded in a git commit.
Which is normally what you want and expect. In this case the change is
a file being removed breifly before being replaced with a new version.
Whether that is a bug is debatable, but it might be a good idea for the
assistant to at least pause committing while it's running a git merge.

The fact that it's committing files with merge conflict markers in them
is certianly a bug. I do wonder if that might be due to annex.resolvemerge
being configured to false; normally the assistant does not merge in a way
that would result in merge conflict markers ever appearing in the working
tree.
