Neither of those options are set AFAICT.

The assistant not trying to commit anything while it's waiting for git to do something else sound like a good idea to me aswell. Shouldn't such behaviour at least be caught by a lockfile though?

Are you able to reproduce the assistant turining unlocked files into merge markers Joey?
