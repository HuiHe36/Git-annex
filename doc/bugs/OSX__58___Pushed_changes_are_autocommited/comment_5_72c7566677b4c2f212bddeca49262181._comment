I just tested this again with 8.20210714 since the assistant got a few improvements but unfortunately this is still just as reproducible.

I also tried setting delayadd since that works with smallfiles properly now but all that does is delay the re-adding of the file it \"deleted\" in the commit before which still happens instantly.
