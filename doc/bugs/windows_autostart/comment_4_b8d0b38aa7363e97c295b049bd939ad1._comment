I’ve also encountered this problem. Found it weird that git-annex on Windows (according to the installation manual) requires Git for Windows to be installed and then defaults to installing itself into the same directory (`C:\Program Files\Git`). Is this required? Won’t this cause problems when Git for Windows updates? That’s why I installed it to `C:\Program Files\git-annex`, but yeah, the link that gets put into `Startup` apparently doesn’t take the real installation directory into account and just uses a hard-coded path…?
