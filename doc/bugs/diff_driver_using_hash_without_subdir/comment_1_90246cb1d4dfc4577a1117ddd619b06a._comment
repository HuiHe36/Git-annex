I think the file in your repo is unlocked. An unlocked file is represented
in git as a pointer file, the pointer contains "/annex/objects/<key>".

Note that git-annex diffdriver exists to let a diff driver work with
annexed files. I think you might want to use it. Amusingly
I forgot about unlocked files in the implementation of it too;
that got fixed in version 8.20210428.
