Your script contains:

	head .git$(cat $2)

How is this using `git-annex diffdriver`? If you were using that,
you would expect `$2` to be the path to the actual location of the annexed
file. So you would not need to cat it, or to append `.git` to it.

Files in the git history can be unlocked, that is a feature that was
introduced in git-annex version 7. See the documentation
<https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-unlock/>
