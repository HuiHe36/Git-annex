Your test case sets the git config after the assistant is running. The
assistant does not notice git config changes made while it's
running, it has to be restarted to pick them up.

I tried setting the config before starting the assistant, and it works
fine.

I assume your real problem does not involve setting the config at the wrong
point in time, so I'll wait for a corrected test case..
