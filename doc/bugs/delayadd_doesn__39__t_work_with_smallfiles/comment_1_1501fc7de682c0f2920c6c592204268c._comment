The assistant scans on startup for changes that happened while it was not
running, and delayadd does not affect those. It only affects changes while
the assistant is running.

I don't think it would be possible to make the startup scan respect
delayadd in general. It could look at mtime, but eg, renaming a file
does not affect its mtime.

Also, the only reason the feature exists is that it can be annoying, when
the assistant is running, to have every little change you make to a file
be recorded; a short delay can let such changes be bundled together.

I will document this and close it.
