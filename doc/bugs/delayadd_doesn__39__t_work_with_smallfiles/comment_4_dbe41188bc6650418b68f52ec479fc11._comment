You are quite correct, the minimal test case works just as expected when the config is applied *before* running the daemon.

`delayadd` has been in my actual repo's config for many months now and has seen countless daemon restarts however, so that can't be my actual problem unfortunately.

Now that I have a working repo, I will try to break it like I did with my regular repo.
