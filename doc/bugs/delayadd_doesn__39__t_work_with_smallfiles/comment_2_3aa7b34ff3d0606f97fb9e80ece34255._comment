Hi Joey, this isn't about startup behaviour.

My use case (and the repro steps) have the assistant up and running before any modifications are done.

My issue is that assistant is commiting my changes instantly with no delay while I'd rather have it bunch up things when I save multiple files in quick succession which is precisely what delayadd is supposed to help with (as you said).

Weirdly however, it just ..doesn't do anything? The date in the file is the exact same as the automatic commit's.
