This seems to be the same error message as in these 2 bugs:

OSX: <https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/__34__rename__58___permission_denied__34__/>

Windows: <https://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/WSL1__58___git-annex-add_fails_in_DrvFs_filesystem/>

So it would be especially helpful if I could reproduce it on Linux. Is
anything else needed other than running git-annex add concurrently? And is that
multiple processes, or with -J?
