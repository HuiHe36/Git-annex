What kind of locking is needed for the v10 upgrade? Everything else is in
place now, but the actual locking is TBD.

My plan above calls for a way to detect if another git-annex process
(v9 or above) is running in the repo. That will be hard to implement
though.. 

It might cause problems with annex.pidlock, if every git-annex
process starts taking a shared lock, because pidlock does not support
shared locks, so only 1 git-annex process will be able to run, perhaps in
situations where multiples can run now even with pidlocking because no
locking is needed.

Also, the existing locking machinery runs in the Annex monad, but such a
lock needs to be implemented in Annex.hs itself, so that would be a
recursive dep. And, it would add overhead to every git-annex process.
(A small amount.)

Alternatively, there could be a top-level lock file that is held shared
whenever locking content files. And the v10 upgrade takes an exclusive
lock. But this seems to fail when a v9 process is running -- if it blocks
on the shared lock for the v10 upgrade, it would still go on the lock in v9
mode in the now v10 repository.
