This is going to need two repository version bumps:

v9: Add the upgrade lock file, and all git-annex processes take a shared
lock to avoid the repository being upgraded out from under them. 
Upgrade is skipped when assistant is running.

v10: Skipped until the upgrade lock file is of a certain age. Take upgrade
lock before increasing annex.version.
In v10, stop locking content files and lock separate lock files.

This way, an old version of git-annex cannot be used in the v9 repository,
and so the v10 upgrade only needs to worry about any git-annex processes
that were started in v8.

The age could be eg 1 month, which assumes that no old git-annex process
like `git-annex move --to remote` is still running after that long.
Of course, that is still an assumption, but it can be pushed out as long as
it takes to feel comfortable with it. Maybe 1 year?

`git-annex upgrade --version=10` could be available to speed up that
upgrade. The user would be responsible for making sure there are no such
old git-annex processes running, so that might need --force.
