I'm still experiencing this bug with 8.20200226. If the repo is cloned by ssh before doing `git annex init`, then the result is:

```
  Unable to parse git config from origin

  Remote origin does not have git-annex installed; setting annex-ignore
```


Creating an empty repo and doing `git annex init` first then adding the remote and pulling in changes works fine, but this creates unrelated history on the `git-annex` branch.


This affects ssh remotes but not local remotes.
