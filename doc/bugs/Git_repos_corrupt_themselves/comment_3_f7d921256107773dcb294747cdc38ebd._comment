The weird thing is, this only ever happens with my Documents git-annex repo, the only one where I use the assistant. It has never happened in 4 years of actively using regular git nor my manually committed and synced git-annex repos.

Another corruption just occured but this time on the MBP:

```

This happened just after I started the assistant/webapp and you can see that I shut it down in the end.

My filesystems are ZFS on the Linux machine and APFS on the MBP. Being an Apple product, I'd expect APFS to be built to high standards (though I don't fully trust it) but ZFS corrupting anything or losing data is almost unheard of.  
I'll try setting `core.fsyncObjectFiles` on this repo and update this issue accordingly when I see another corruption with it on. Shouldn't take too long as this occurs worringly frequently.

Btw, repair always fails in my setup because git seems to be unable to find the `SOTERIA` remote; is it trying to use the remote name literally as an address perhaps?
