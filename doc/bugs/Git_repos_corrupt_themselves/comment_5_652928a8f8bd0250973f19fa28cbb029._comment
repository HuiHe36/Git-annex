Another crash on the Linux machine as I was starting the assistant today. Usually it doesn't happen nearly this frequently though.

`core.fsyncObjectFiles` was set to `true` this time.

log.3 (2d ago 19:xx):

```
git-annex: internal error: evacuate: strange closure type 4566880
    (GHC version 8.10.4 for x86_64_unknown_linux)
    Please report this as a GHC bug:  https://www.haskell.org/ghc/reportabug
```

log.2 (today 10:16):

```
<regular git-annex fsck output>
ControlSocket .git/annex/ssh/e5a88504f7bbb083855b27a1c1ca4a26 already exists, disabling multiplexing

```

at the time of log.1 (10:55), corruption has already set in.

I'm sniffing an issue with the auto-repair feature wrongly detecting corruption, trying to fix it and thereby actually corrupting the repo. I'd like to turn it off for investigation, is that possible somehow? By disabling consistency checks perhaps?
