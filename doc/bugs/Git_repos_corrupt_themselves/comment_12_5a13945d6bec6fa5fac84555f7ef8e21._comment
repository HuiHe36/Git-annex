This seems conclusive that the repair is somehow triggering unncessarily
and also corrupting the repo in this situation.

The comment #3 log shows that the repair is started, and then 1 minute
later a git object is missing.

(It's odd that log shows a second fsck run after the repair was already
triggered. I do not see a way that this would happen unless fscks are
scheduled very close together.)

The automatic repair is supposed to be a non-destructive repair; the
destructive repair only happens after prompting in the UI.

This also reminds me of a persistent issue with a git-annex repo, using the
assistant, on my sister's laptop corrupting itself.
