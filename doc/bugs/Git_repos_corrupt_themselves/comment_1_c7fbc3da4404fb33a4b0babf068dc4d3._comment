git-annex does not write directly to your git repository; all writes go via
git. So it is hard to see how any corruption like this could be due to a
bug in git-annex.

What it usually is caused by is a filesystem losing data, eg because of an
unclean shutdown or a crash, or sometimes because of a disk error.

Setting the git config core.fsyncObjectFiles may help. Configuring the
filesystem to write data to disk more promptly (eg enabling journalling of
file contents) may help.

`git-annex repair --force` may be able to recover from this situation.

The "evacuate: strange closure" error does seem notable, something strange
is going on in the memory of git-annex. Presumably due to either a compiler
bug or some kind of memory problem.
