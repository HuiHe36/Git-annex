The repair process moves all pack files to a temp dir and then unpacks the
loose objects from them. So, there is a time window, when the repair is
running, where git objects that were present before will be missing. And if
the assistant stops before that is complete, it would leave it in that
state. Unpacking pack files can take a long time, so this might
be a sufficient explanation.

But then, something must be causing it to incorrectly think it needs
a repair in the first place. Assuming it is incorrect, of course. Either git
fsck is exiting nonzero for some reason, or git-annex is thinking
it sees git fsck complain about a missing object, that is not really
missing. While there are fsck outputs that it can misinterpret, it
double-checks by trying to cat the object, which should avoid the latter
problem.
