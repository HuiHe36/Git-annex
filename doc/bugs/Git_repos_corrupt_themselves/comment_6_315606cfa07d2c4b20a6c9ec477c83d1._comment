Note that the strange closure crash is a separate bug,
and has been fixed in git master. I do not think that bug could corrupt git
repos since as I mentioned before git-annex doesn't write directly to the
git repo, so any such bug in it should not be possible to corrupt it.

Anyway, it would probably be a good idea to upgrade to a current daily
build to get past that bug.
