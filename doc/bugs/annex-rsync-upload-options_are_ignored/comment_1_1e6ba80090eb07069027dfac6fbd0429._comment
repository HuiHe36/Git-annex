Since that old version of git-annex, it has changed to using a different
protocol than rsync for transfers over ssh. So the rsync options no longer
apply to that. They are still used when git-annex does use rsync, either a
rsync special remote or a server with too old a version of git-annex to use
the new protocol.

I think the main thing lost by this is bandwidth throttling.
There is an open todo at [[todo/bwlimit]] to implement that in a way that
will work more broadly than rsync's --bwlimit.

Maybe also  --ipv4/--ipv6, but ssh configs can probably be used to
accomplish the same thing as that.
