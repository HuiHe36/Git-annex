On DragonflyBSD with git-annex built with ghc 8.10.7, a simple `git annex add` puts strange entries in the index, as shown:

```
copter-dfly tmp $ mkdir d
copter-dfly tmp $ cd d
copter-dfly d $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/falsifian/tmp/d/.git/
copter-dfly d $ git annex init
init  ok
(recording state in git...)
copter-dfly d $ echo test>f
copter-dfly d $ git annex add f
add f
ok
(recording state in git...)
copter-dfly d $ git status
On branch master

copter-dfly d $
```

Digging into it further with dfly people over IRC, it's been discovered:

* The bug does not appear with ghc 8.10.5, with git-annex 20210903 or 20210223.
* But it consistently happens with ghc 8.10.7, with all the versions I tried.
* I also noticed that `git annex init` does not create the file `.git/annex/index` when the bug is present.

Has anyone tried git-annex with ghc 8.10.7 on a different OS?

I tried to figure out why `.git/annex/index` was not being created, but I had some trouble figuring out which line of code is supposed to create it. If someone could point me there I could do some further debugging to see why it isn't created.
