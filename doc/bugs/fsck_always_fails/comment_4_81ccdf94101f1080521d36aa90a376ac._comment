Well, you somehow marked the repo you're working in as dead. Usually you only mark a repo that is irretrievably lost (due to drive failure for example) as dead so git-annex knows that none of the data in it exists anymore and doesn't count it as a copy anymore. That's exactly what you're seeing here.
