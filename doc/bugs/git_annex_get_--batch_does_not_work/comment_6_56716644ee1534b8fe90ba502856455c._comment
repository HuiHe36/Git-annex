According to the git-annex info output, `Wasabi` is a directory.

Since a directory is not an annexed file, git-annex get --batch will
not get it, so it outputs a blank line. If you tell it to get a specific file
within that directory, it will.

Since git-annex info --batch can operate on directories as well as on files,
it does. That is the reason for the inconsistency.
