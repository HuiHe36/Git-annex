### Please describe the problem.

On a user Windows machine, we get an odd issue of being unable to `annex get` a file from an ssh remote ([https://gin.g-node.org/yarikoptic/test-annex](https://gin.g-node.org/yarikoptic/test-annex)) while using an ssh key with a passphrase.  The reason seems to be that 2nd invocation of `ssh` by git-annex does not result in the prompt for the passphrase.

I failed to reproduce locally in Windows VM machine.  In my case (probably different setup of ssh etc), I 1). get passphrase prompt via external gui window (not in the same terminal); 2). do get 2nd prompt as well.

[Here you can get a full log](http://www.onerussian.com/tmp/test-annex-output-windows-ssh-passphrase-20211209.txt) where you can see passphrase prompt for initial clone, then within `get` once and not after 2nd ssh call


```
