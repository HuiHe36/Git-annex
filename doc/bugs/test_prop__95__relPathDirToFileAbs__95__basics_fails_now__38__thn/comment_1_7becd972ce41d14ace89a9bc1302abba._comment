Reproduced on Linux using System.FilePath.Windows.

Minimal case is:

	ghci> let p = "\\\\\DLEJ\STXm{u5;4*\EOTKo1"
	ghci> relPathDirToFileAbs (p </> "bar") p
	"\\\\\DLEJ\STXm{u5;4*\EOTKo1"

Which should be "bar", but the "normdrive" case in
relPathDirToFileAbs causes it to not return that.

Ah, that whole value is treated as a "drive letter" due to starting
with "\\\\" and not containing any path separator.

	ghci> takeDrive p
	"\\\\\DLEJ\STXm{u5;4*\EOTKo1"

And takeDrive includes the first path separator, which is present in one
string and not in another. So, it thinks these paths are on
two different drives, when they are not. And that's the root
of the problem. normdrive was working around that by taking up until 
the ':', but there *is* no ':' in this drive letter!
