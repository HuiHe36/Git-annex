So this makes me think that [[!73df633a6215faa093e4a7524c6d328aa988aed1]]
needs to be reverted and the inode number used again. But that did fix a
bug of a sort, that importing from a fat filesystem after it was remounted
would re-import everything. So I suppose the best that can be done is to
make it configurable whether inodes should be ignored or not when importing
from a directory special remote. And presumably default to not ignoring
them.
