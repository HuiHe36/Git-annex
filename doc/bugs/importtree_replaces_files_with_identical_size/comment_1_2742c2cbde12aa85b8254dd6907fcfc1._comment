The directory special remote use the size and mtime as the
ContentIdentifier of a file. It used to use inode number as well, but
some filesystems make up new inodes on each mount so that was dropped.

So when two files have the same size and mtime, it will import one of them,
and then when it comes to the other one, see that it already has that
ContentIdentifier and use the content it already imported.

For example:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp/t>git-annex initremote d type=directory directory=../d importtree=yes exporttree=yes encryption=none
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/t>echo hi > ../d/1
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/t>echo no > ../d/2
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/t>touch --reference=../d/1 ../d/2
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/t>git-annex import master --from d
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/t>git merge d/master 
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/t>cmp 1 2
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/t>

Perhaps NextCloud is for some reason giving multiple files the same mtime?

This is rather unlikely to happen naturally, especially on modern
filesystems that have high resolution mtimes. Even "echo 1> 1; echo 2>2"
generates files with 2 different mtimes. To get the same mtime, the two
files have to be written by the same process at very close to the same
time.

Probably that's why NextCloud managed to get the same mtime, although why
it would be rewriting the content of the file when the content had not
changed I don't know and perhaps that's a bug of some kind in it.
