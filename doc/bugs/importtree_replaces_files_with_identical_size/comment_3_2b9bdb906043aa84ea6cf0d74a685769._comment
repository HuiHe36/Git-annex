First of all, thank you very much for the quick fix!

I don't think that Nextcloud rewrote these files as otherwise git-annex would have re-imported them instead of recognizing the exported files. Using stat, I confirm that the replaced files have indeed the exactly same modify time - `Modify: 2021-12-19 22:47:35.988712668 +0100`. I think this is the time when I copied these files from a different directory, as this does not correspond to the modify time of the original files (that I still have). Quite interestingly, the access time of both original files is also the exactly same time, which supports this hypothesis. I can reproduce that copying a couple of small files using cp gives me target files with exactly identical modify times (in fact, all time stamps stat displays are identical). Steps to reproduce:

```
for i in $(seq 32); do dd if=/dev/urandom of=file${i}.test bs=20k count=1; done
mkdir d
cp *.test d/
stat d/*.test
```

For me, this reproduces both on ext4 and on tmpfs.
