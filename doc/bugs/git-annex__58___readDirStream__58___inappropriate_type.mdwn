No idea.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Yes. This is my third attempt at getting git-annex running. Conceptually, I think it's the best thing out there. I've had some success at moving around data. But I tend to end up in these dead ends...
