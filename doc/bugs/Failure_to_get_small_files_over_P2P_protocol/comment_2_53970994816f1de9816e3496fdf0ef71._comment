Hi Joey,

Thank you for having a look at this, but we can put this one under \"my own stupidity\". The files that give these errors are apparently only status files which get rewritten every time you play a recording, so they continuously get rewritten, get \"git annex add\"ed with a cron job, but don't always get pushed before they get overwritten, so yeah, it's not unexpected that some of these may get lost at some point.
Still no real data lost though, but errors like these worry me enough to file a bug report.

regards,
Tim
