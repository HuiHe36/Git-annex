This seems to be a reversion caused by incremental verification. In
P2P.Annex it does incremental verification, and so it notices that the temp
file is corrupted. So, the transfer fails, and the temp file is left
behind.

So I suppose the fix is that, whenever doing incremental verification,
also delete the temp file when it fails.
