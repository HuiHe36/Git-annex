### Please describe the problem.
The version of git-annex available on OpenBSD is quite old.
I've tried building a more recent version with cabal install git-annex, but this also failed. I guess these tools are also rather old.
Unfortunately I have zero experience with Haskell and only mediocre OpenBSD skills. 
I'm hoping someone can pick this up and build a more up-to-date version.

- git-annex-8.20210223p1
- cabal-install-3.4.0.0p2
- ghc-8.10.6p0

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
I've used it extensively during my time at university to keep track of materials and assignments. It ever let me down.
Unfortunately I later lost the data due to multiple corrupted external disks and backup drives with LUKS where I didn't remember the password. Luckily I had no use for it anymore anyway.
I'm hoping to use it again, this time in an effort to disconnect.
