Thanks for a good repo recipe. I only needed to add a "borg init
$BORG_REPO -e none" to see the bug.

The bug is because it had to make the path to the borg repo absolute,
since it's running borg inside a temp directory. And the case of a ssh
location was not considered when doing that.

Fixed and cleaned up the BorgRepo data type to avoid this kind of dumb
mistake in the future. ;-)
