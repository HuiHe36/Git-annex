I doubt this bisection was correct. Whether git commit decides to smudge a
file is entirely an internal decision on the part of git; the only way
git-annex can affect it is by updating the mtime etc of the file.

Even small things like variations in timing can change git's smudging
behavior. It may unncessarily re-smudge a file when its timestamp is
sufficiently close to the current time. For whatever internal value
of "sufficiently close" it happens to pick for a given
OS/filesystem/whatever.
