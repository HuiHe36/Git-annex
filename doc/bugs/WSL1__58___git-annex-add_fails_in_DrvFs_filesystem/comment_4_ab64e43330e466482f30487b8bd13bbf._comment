Interesting, thanks for that analysis.

I don't like the prospect of adding hacks to git-annex on linux to deal
with infelicities of WSL1. WSL should emulate linux well, and to the
extent it does not, that seems Microsoft's problem, not mine.

However, I wonder what that analysis implies about the other linked bugs
with similar error messages, which are on OSX and (probably) Linux.

What could be done to detect this drvfs problem is to add this case to the
probing that's done for crippled filesystems. Then it would take the
nohardlink path.

But drvfs is used for /mnt/c/ etc, so that would make most all repos on WSL1 be
treated as in a crippled filesystem, using unlocked adjusted branches, etc.

Also, I seem to remember using git-annex in WSL1 in /mnt/c/ and git-annex
add presumably working. So I wonder what has changed.
