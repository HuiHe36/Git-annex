Current list of items that need to be fixed before this is mergeable:

- When there is a transition in one of the remote git-annex branches
  that has not yet been applied to the local or other git-annex branches.
  Transitions are not handled.
- `git-annex log` runs git log on the git-annex branch, and so
  it will not be able to show information coming from the other, not yet
  merged branches.
- Annex.Branch.files only looks at files in the git-annex branch and not
  unmerged branches. This affects git-annex info output.
- Annex.Branch.hs.overBranchFileContents ditto. Affects --all and
  also importfeed (but importfeed cannot work in a read-only repo
  anyway).
- CmdLine.Seek.seekFilteredKeys when precaching location logs.
  Note use of Annex.Branch.fullname
- Database.ContentIdentifier.needsUpdateFromLog and updateFromLog
- (skip) `--in=repository@{date}` uses loggedLocationsHistorical which uses
  Annex.Branch.getHistorical, which does not look at unmerged branches.
  But perhaps this is ok.. This uses the reflog, so when used to query
  eg files that were present in the past, it means ones that the local
  git-annex branch thought were present; other git-annex branches
  may have had a different opinion but it will not show those.
  And another way to look at it, the result for this will be the same
  before and after merging those branches.
