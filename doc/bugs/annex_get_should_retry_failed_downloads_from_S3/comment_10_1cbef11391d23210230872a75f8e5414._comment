Update: All problems noted above are fixed, fine-grained locking is merged, 
and it seems to work well!

Except for this, which I have not gotten to. It may not actually matter, but
worth looking at to be sure: 

`getLockStatus` and `checkSaneLock` look at the status of the pid lock,
but not yet at the fine-grained STM lock status. And as implemented,
I think they never worked at all, since they check for posix locks on the
pid lock file.
