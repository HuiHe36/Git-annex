The french output is by git, not git-annex. It looks like the standard
message about there being a merge conflict. One part of the git
output is not translated and it happens to be the part that explains
what is going on.

	warning: Cannot merge binary files: metadata.db (HEAD vs. refs/remotes/origin/master)

So metadata.db is a binary file, so it is not stored in git-annex,
but is checked directly into git. Or at least it is on one side of
the merge conflict.

I think that one repository added metadata.db to git-annex, and the other
added it to directly into git. So then the merge conflict is between
the binary content of the file and the git-annex symlink. Which is an
actual merge conflict, even though the content of the file is the same.

That kind of merge conflict is when `git-annex sync` resolves the merge
conflict with a single `.variant` file for the annexed version along side the
regular file as stored in git. Which is what your ls showed. 
You can resolve the merge conflict by either deleting the annexed
 `.variant` file or renaming it over the file stored in git.

You can avoid this kind of merge conflict by configuring annex.largefiles
the same in both repositories, so when a file like metadata.db gets added
separately in each repository, the same annex link will be added.

Or you can set annex.resolvemerge to false for sync to avoid resolving merge
conflicts, and then just resolve them yourself.

I don't see a bug here, this is all documented.
