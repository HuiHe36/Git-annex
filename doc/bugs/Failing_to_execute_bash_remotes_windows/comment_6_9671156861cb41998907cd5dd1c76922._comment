@datamanager this bug report is about a Windows-specific problem,
and it was fixed in 2017. You seem to be using Android, unless
Windows has gotten a termux app that I am not aware of?

It seems likely to me that if you look at 
/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/git-annex-remote-rclone,
it will start with "#!/bin/bash", and perhaps your android device
does not have a /bin/bash to run it with. Modifying the script to
use the path to termux's bash would probably fix that.
