reversion in [[!commit f46e4c9b7c]], which reversed some logic and made
database reads be treated as database writes, so they failed on permission
denied, rather than the right behavior of returning DbUnavailable. Fixed that. 

I have not been able to reproduce the other error involving
opening a temp file. All I can tell from the message is that it's writing
to some file in .git/annex via a temp file in the same directory.
