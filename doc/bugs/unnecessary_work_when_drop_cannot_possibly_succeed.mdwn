When annex.numcopies is 4, and there are only 4 copies of a file,
`git-annex drop` behaves like this:

	drop me (locking a2...) (locking a3...) (locking a4...) (unsafe)
	  Could only verify the existence of 3 out of 4 necessary copies

That is unncessary work, because the drop cannot possibly succeed when
there are not more than numcopies. It should be able to skip locking the
content on remotes and immediately fail. 

A user reported a situation where this happened to a lot of files and
caused rate limiting and slowed down git-annex sync. --[[Joey]]
