This is odd because the test suite says
that "git-annex import" failed, but its
output "list foo ok" seems to indicate it succeeded.
(There is no other output apparently.)

commitRemote outputs "update" when it starts, so it apparently
never got that far. Seems to leave a failure in importKeys
that somehow crashes it without an error message.

I can't think of a way that git-annex could crash without an error message,
unless it was an external problem eg a SIGEGV or OOM killer or something like
that.
