Both local and remote git annex has version 10.20220127-ge6e60b644.

Initially both my local and remote repos had version 8.  I used `git annex upgrade` to upgrade them to 9 then 10, but the problem persisted.

I tried running the `git-annex-shell p2pstdio` command in the server shell after sshing in and it worked.
I also tried a different git-annex-shell command (configlist) remotely from local with `ssh -T`, and it worked too.

But when I do p2pstdio remotely with `ssh -T` I get

```
fatal: Run with no arguments or with -c cmd
git-annex-shell: git-shell failed
```
