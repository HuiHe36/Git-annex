@ycp it is very possible that you also have an older version of git-annex
installed on the server, in such a way that the newer version is in PATH
when you log in interactively, but the older version is when you log in
non-interactively.

See <https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/get_git-annex-shell_into_PATH/>

Note that "Run with no arguments or with -c cmd" is not a git-annex
message. It is a message output by git-shell, eg:

> git-shell -c p2pstdio foo
> fatal: Run with no arguments or with -c cmd

This probably means that git-annex-shell, not understanding the "p2pstdio"
command, has passed it on to git-shell, which failed like that. Which hints
very strongly that you do indeed have an old git-annex-shell in PATH at
that point.
