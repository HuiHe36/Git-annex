From the NEWS file:

	git-annex (8.20211028) upstream; urgency=medium
	
	  This version of git-annex removes support for communicating with git-annex
	  remotes that have version 6.20180312 or older installed.

So you will need to upgrade your remote.

I'm leaving this bug report open because it currently fails without
explaining why, and it would be good to indicate that the remote is too old
if possible. (I am not, however, unsure if it's actually possible to do
that.)
