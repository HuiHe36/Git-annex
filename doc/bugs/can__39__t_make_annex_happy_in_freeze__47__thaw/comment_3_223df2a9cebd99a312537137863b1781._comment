Looks like, while init does run the freeze hook in its test,
as well as trying to remove the write bits (which it always does, freeze
hook or no freeze hook), it still checks if the file's write permissions
got removed.

I think that, in order to support filesystems where chmod -w has no effect,
init should skip looking at perms when there is a freeze hook. It can
still check that freezing prevents writing to a file.
