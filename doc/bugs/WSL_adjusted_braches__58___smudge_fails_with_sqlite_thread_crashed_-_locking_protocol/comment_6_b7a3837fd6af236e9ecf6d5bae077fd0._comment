@asakurareiko it makes sense it would fail that way with WAL disabled,
since the sqlite database cannot support multiple writers then. And
there are probably several situations where multiple git-annex processes
end up using the database, even when you are only running a single
git-annex command at a time.

Sounds like `restagePointerFile`, which tends to run at the
end of such an operation to handle all the files that have been updated. 
That runs `git update-index`, which then runs `git-annex smudge`.
So both the parent and child git-annex process can have the database open
for write, which WAL mode normally supports, but something in WSL prevents
it from working right.

Following this theory, I've made `restagePointerFile` close the database
first. Perhaps that will avoid the problem, at least in those cases. Your
testing is appreciated.
