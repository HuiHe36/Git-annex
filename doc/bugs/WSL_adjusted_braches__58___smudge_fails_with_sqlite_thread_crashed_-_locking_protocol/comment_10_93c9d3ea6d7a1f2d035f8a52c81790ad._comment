The error I get previously (before [[!commit 0f38ad9a6]]) with my test case is

```
init

  Disabling ssh connection caching.

With [[!commit d0ef8303c]], the test case still works, but adjusted branches still have the same error. 

```
git init
git annex init
git config annex.crippledfilesystem true
echo aaa > a
cp a b
git annex add .
git commit -m .
git annex adjust --unlock
```

produces

```

About `git-annex version`, I'm using `make install-home` to do an incremental build but the version does not update.
