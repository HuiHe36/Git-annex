@asakurareiko oh that's encouraging that I seem to be on the right track.

Adjusted branches still have the same error?

I noticed that
git-annex opened a second connection to the database for writes, in
addition to the connection it used for reads. That seems likely to be
involved in whatever locking problem there is on WSL.

Commit [[!commit d0ef8303cf8c4f40a1d17bd134af961fd9917ca4]] eliminates that
second connection. But there's some chance I'll have to revert it.

If you test, please include `git-annex version` output
so I can make sure you have a version with that change.

I also wonder if this means that running 2 git-annex commands
simulantaneously will sometimes result in the same sqlite problem, despite
these fixes.
