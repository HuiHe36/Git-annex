Yes the problem occurs each time I want to do git annex get . on a repository with about 20 000 files. 

As i say, I've perfom memtest86 (several times) and memtester (several times) without any problem. Do you think it could be hardware problem despite these results ?

You suggest using gdb. I get

Thread 1 \"git-annex\" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000003c6be67 in ?? ()

(gdb) backtrace

#0  0x0000000003c6be67 in ?? ()
#1  0x0000000000000000 in ?? ()

which is not very helpful. Do you have any advices to investigate?
