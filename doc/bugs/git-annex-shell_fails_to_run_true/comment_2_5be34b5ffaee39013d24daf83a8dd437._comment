the problem was that i had a `~/git-shell-commands/rsync` overriding the rsync command to try to restrict *that*, since i'm using a gcrypt remote... it was clunky and badly designed and, ultimately, insecure. i replaced it with `rrsync /home/anarcat/offsite/` but even that is not the best either, as the script says it \"assumes someone will not subvert the rsync protocol\" which hardly seems reassuring.

i also had to change my remotes to follow the \"chroot\" of sorts:

    git config remote.offsite-annex.annex-rsyncurl anarcat@remote-annex:Videos.annex/
    git remote set-url offsite-git gcrypt::rsync://anarcat@remote-annex:Videos.git/

Running `git fetch` by hand convinced me the problem wasn't git-annex related... From there I reread the git-annex-shell and git-shell commands and noticed that bit about the obscure `git-shell-commands` directory, and found that jem. I even had an error in `journalctl -f` that confirm the problem, something i overlooked as well...

so this indeed seems like a problem on my end. sorry for the delay and the noise!
