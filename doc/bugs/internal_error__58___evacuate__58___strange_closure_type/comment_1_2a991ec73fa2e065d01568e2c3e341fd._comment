I'm seeing this too, although sometimes it seems to crash out before that
gets written to the log. And sometimes it manages to get running and seems
to run ok.

It does not happen with --foreground AFAICS.

Reproduced it with that most recent standalone release, and also with a
local dev build, also with ghc 8.8.4.

This would usually be a ghc or library bug, as there's no code in git-annex
low-level enough to cause this kind of memory corruption or whatever it is.

But, the assistant does one really funky thing for a haskell program, and that
is forking to the background. It seems just possible that doing that has
started confusing the garbage collector in some way.

forkProcess is really problimatic with its handling of threads etc,
and this may be the signal that git-annex needs to stop using it.
