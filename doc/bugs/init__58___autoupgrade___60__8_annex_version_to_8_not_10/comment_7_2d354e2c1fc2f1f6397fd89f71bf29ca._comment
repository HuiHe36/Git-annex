> I think you are making this a lot more complex than it will appear to any user. These versions are almost indistinguishable by the user; v9 is literally one git config change from v8.

well, to me as a user those upgrades become immediately visible whenever older (not yet supporting v9) version of git-annex tries to operate on v9 repository (regardless how trivial the change between 8 and 9 is).

I recommended adding explicit \"default\" primarily because you cited man pages as the operational/design guide, and I felt that it is incomplete.

> I suspect your test suite is unncessarily fragile around git-annex repository version numbers, perhaps that is the real root of your problem?

might be... although I can proudly state that may be not -- we had only 2 (out of many 100s) tests failing, so at least that check seems to be quite nicely isolated in our tests.  And insofar seems have pointed to a defect in git-annex (they are all back to green, woohoo! ;) ). Having stated that -- we might indeed want to adjust them.
