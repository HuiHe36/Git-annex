Hmm, the git-annex-upgrade man page says "Upgrades the repository to the latest version"
and v10 is the latest version now. --version=8 will do what you want.
I think that people would generally be surprised if `git-annex upgrade` did
not upgrade to the latest supported version.

As for `git-annex init --version=6`, v6 is not a supported version, so that
was upgrading to v8 before. The git-annex-init man page says
"When the version given is one that automatically upgrades to a newer
version, it will automatically use the newer version instead."
and v6 does automatically upgrade to v10 now, so again this behavior is
following the documentation. Although so I suppose would be using v8 in the
brief amount of time v10 is not upgraded to by default.
