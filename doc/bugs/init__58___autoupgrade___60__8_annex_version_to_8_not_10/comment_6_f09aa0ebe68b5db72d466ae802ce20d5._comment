I think you are making this a lot more complex than it will appear to any
user. These versions are almost indistinguishable by the user; v9 is
literally one git config change from v8.

And also, I reserve the right to make it do *anything that makes sense*
around upgrades. Overspecifying the behavior will constrain future
upgrades. Repository upgrades often already involve threading a very fine
needle, making the hole artificially smaller does not seem wise.

I suspect your test suite is unncessarily fragile around git-annex
repository version numbers, perhaps that is the real root of your
problem?
