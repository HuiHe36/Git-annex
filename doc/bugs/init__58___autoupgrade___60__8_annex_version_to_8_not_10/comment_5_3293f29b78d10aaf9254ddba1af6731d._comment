cool, so I think there is one missing (from documentation) notion of the \"default\" version (in addition to \"supported\", \"upgradeable\" and \"latest\" which is = max(\"supported\")). If so -- I think 
- the \"default\" version should be listed in `git annex version` as \"default version:\" in addition to \"supported\" and \"upgradable\"
- `git-annex-init` man page could say \"When the version given is older than default version, it will automatically use the newer default version instead.\"
- may be `git-annex-upgrade` man page would say \"Upgrades the repository to a supported version.\", and allow for upgrade to `default` or `latest` (probably get `--version` option to specify which?) with \"default\" being the default version to upgrade to (thus staying consistent with git-annex-init upgrading to default, not latest)?

I think that might make present difference between \"default\" and \"latest\" clearer.
