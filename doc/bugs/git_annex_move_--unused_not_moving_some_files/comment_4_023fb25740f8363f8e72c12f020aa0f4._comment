> You did say it's not moving \"some files\" which suggests maybe it is moving other ones? Do you see it move any unused files at all?
                                                                                                                        
It's moving most of it, just not all of them!

`git annex whereis --unused` lists the files. `git annex copy --unused -t bims` OTOH does not do anything. I also tried `git annex drop --unused --in=bims` in an attempt to emulate `git annex move --unused -t bims`, but this also does not do anything.

I don't think that's the issue: If you look above, `here` and `bims` have different UUIDs. (I also notice the files are already on the `bims` remote.)
