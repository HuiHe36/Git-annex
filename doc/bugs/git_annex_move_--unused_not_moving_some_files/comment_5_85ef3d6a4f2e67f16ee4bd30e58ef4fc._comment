Well it's not surprising that `git annex copy -t bims` does nothing when
the files are in the remote. Although it would normally display 
each unused key and just say "ok" when it verifies that the remote has the
content.

But move and drop doing nothing while whereis does is strange. It
must not be a problem with getting the list of unused keys, since whereis
works.

You showed `git annex move` not displaying any output, which is what's
really weird. Does `git annex drop --unused --in bims` display any output?
What about `git annex copy -t bims`?
