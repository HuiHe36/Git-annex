It seems likely to me that the directory you're trying to use git-annex in
either no longer exists, or is in some other strange state.

I can get close to this error message by asking for 
the contents of the directory "/etc/passwd". Of course,
that file is not a directory.

	ghci> System.Directory.getDirectoryContents "/etc/passwd"
	*** Exception: /etc/passwd: getDirectoryContents:openDirStream: inappropriate type (Not a directory)

I have not found a way to make readDirStream throw the error, but this
shows that the problem is basically something to do with getting directory
contents.

stracing git-annex might shed some more light on how the `readdir()`
syscall is failing.
