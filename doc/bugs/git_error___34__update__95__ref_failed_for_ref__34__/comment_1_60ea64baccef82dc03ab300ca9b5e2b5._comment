This is similar to configuring git with a remote that has spaces in its
name:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp/z>git remote add "My Remote" ../x
	fatal: 'My Remote' is not a valid remote name

Or configuring a remote.foo.fetch with spaces in the name of the rev:

	joey@darkstar:/tmp/y>git config remote.origin.fetch
	+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/Redmi Note 8/*
	joey@darkstar:/tmp/y>git fetch origin
	fatal: invalid refspec '+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/Redmi Note 8/*'

Importing from a special remote with importtree=yes is equivilant from
pulling from a git remote, and needs to update a branch with a similar
name as origin/master. And with a remote name with spaces, there is
no legal branch name that will work.

So, this has to fail. It could fail earlier, or with a better error
message.
