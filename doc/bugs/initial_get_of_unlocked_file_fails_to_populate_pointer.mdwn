Clone a repository containing an unlocked file, and `git annex get` it. The
object is transferred, but the pointer file does not get populated.
(`git annex fsck` will then notice and correct the problem.)

If any other git-annex command is run before the get, it avoids the
problem. So the problem has to do with autoinit followed by reading
associated files from the keys db.
