Clone a repository containing an unlocked file, and `git annex get` it. The
object is transferred, but the pointer file does not get populated.
(`git annex fsck` will then notice and correct the problem.)

If any other git-annex command is run before the get, it avoids the
problem. So the problem has to do with autoinit followed by reading
associated files from the keys db.

Bisected to [[!commit 428c91606b434512d1986622e751c795edf4df44]] --[[Joey]] 

It seems that reconcileStaged is populating the
associated files, but later when they're queried, the query returns an
empty list. So something to do with database write caching.

Somehow, not having init call `scanAnnexedFiles` makes this bug go away.
