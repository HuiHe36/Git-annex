### Please describe the problem.

Any time git-annex reads a file (and presumably hashes it), it is about half as fast as just reading the file or `sha256sum`ing it on my hardware.

The repo I'm reading from is inside a btrfs on top of an HDD but the same happens in a btrfs image inside a tmpfs and inside a tmpfs directly, just to a lesser degree as there is no IO or filesystem overhead.

My CPU is pretty slow but reading a 1.7GiB file normally or even checksumming it is about an order of magnitude faster:

|Command|Time|
|:--|--:|
|`git-annex fsck file`| 21s |
|`sha256sum file`| 5s |
|`cat file > /dev/null`| 2s |

(Tested inside a btrfs image in tmpfs with same settings (compress etc.))

This also happens on `add`, `copy`, `get` etc. but it's even worse there because of higher IO overhead which results in average speeds of ~70MiB/s.  
I'm currently in the process of transferring a few terabytes worth from multiple relatively slower drives onto one very fast drive and would like to parallelise the transfer. Unfortunately though, this issue seems to scale anti-proportionally with the level of parallelism. If I'd get 70MiB/s from each drive individually at `-J1`, I'd get ~35MiB/s from both at `-J2`.

I had to resort to `rsync`ing the objects dirs manually as that's faster than any method of git-annex-internal transfers.

### What steps will reproduce the problem?

Compare runtime of `git-annex fsck` vs. `sha256sum` and `cat`.

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)
