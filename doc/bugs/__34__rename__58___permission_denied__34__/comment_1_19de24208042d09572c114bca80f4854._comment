git-annex is hard linking the file to the temp directory with "ingest-" in its
name. Then later it renames that into .git/annex/objects/

So the permissions problem must involve one of those directories, but neither
seems likely. The newly created temp file is in a directory whose permissions
certainly let it delete it since they let it create it there. The destination
directory gets its write bit set before the rename.

I wonder if some of these files, or other files you're
adding might have identical content? It seems possible that there
could be some concurrency related problem with that. Although I
have not been able to produce any.

Something OSX specific, possibly...
