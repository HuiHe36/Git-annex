## I'm considering this a "false alarm", but leaving it around for others who may run into it

It took a long time to add the files (50 minutes). When I did, and did a `git status`, the ones that failed due to "permission denied" just appeared as having not been added. I added them, and it worked fine. I have no reason to believe that my folder has gotten corrupted.

So I don't personally think this needs fixing. But if anyone else out there runs into this issue, at least this page is here.


### Please describe the problem.

When adding 400k files to a new annex, I get an error "rename: permission denied". It doesn't seem to be about file permissions (I have `chown`ed them), and it's inconsistent from run to run. So each time I try the import, different files may show the permission denied error.

One thing I'm concerned about is how to confirm whether these files have made it into annex, or if I now have a corrupted folder structure.

I do intend to do smaller imports, or try using `-J1`.


### What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. `git config annex.jobs cpus`
2. `git annex add .`

### Have you had any luck using git-annex before? (Sometimes we get tired of reading bug reports all day and a lil' positive end note does wonders)

Absolutely! :)
