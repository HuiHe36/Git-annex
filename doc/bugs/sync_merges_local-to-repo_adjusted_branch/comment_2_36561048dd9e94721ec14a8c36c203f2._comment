Like Lukey said, your output does not show branches being "forcibly merged". What it shows
is `git fetch WD250G` running and fetching a
"WD250G/adjusted/master(hidemissing)" ref. That updates a previous version
of that it fetched from the remote before.

Nothing else will be done with that ref, as far as I can see. It's just
being maintained by git as a remote tracking branch, the same as it would
keep track of any other branch that happened to be on the remote.

You can configure git to not fetch this or other branches, by
changing the remote.WD250G.fetch git config.

Now, what `git annex sync` does do, when in an adjusted branch, is
propigate any changes that you have made to that branch back to the master
branch, and then it pushes the master branch over to the remote. And if the
remote is also in an adjusted branch, then running `git annex sync` on
the remote will merge in those changes from the master branch. But
when the branch is a --hide-missing branch, this process does not cause
files that are missing on the one repo to get deleted from the branch on
the other repo.
