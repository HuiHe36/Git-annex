I have added a note to the S3 documentation about `DEEP_ARCHIVE` and the
glacier special remote.

I have made git-annex display the exception for the more likely chunked 
location, rather than the less likely unchunked location, when retrieving
from both locations fails. Although it's still possible for there to be
situations where the exception if displays is not for the location where
the content actually is. Eg, if the chunk size of the remote has
changed over time.

I think that todo is basically talking about the same desire to make the S3
remote support these glacier-style storage classes, in one way or another, 
and so I think this bug report can be closed as otherwise a duplicate of it.
