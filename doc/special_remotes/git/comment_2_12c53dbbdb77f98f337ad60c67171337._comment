This can only be used for git remotes that have an annex-uuid set. All
special remotes have to have a uuid. git remotes that are hosted on a
system with git-annex installed get the annex-uuid set up automatically,
but it won't happen if your special remote is on github or something like
that. You could `git config remote.foo.annex-uuid $(uuid)` to generate and 
set a new uuid, I suppose.
