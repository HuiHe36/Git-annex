Following the instructions here, I cannot enable the remote. The error message is: `git-annex: Unknown remote name.`. I assume this is because git annex does not create a uuid for the type=git special remote, presumably because non is set for the actual git remote (the annex-uuid key does not exist for the existing git remote with the same url). This is the relevant line generated in remote.log: ` autoenable=true location=<ssh-url> name=<name> type=git timestamp=1629118438.628919s`, as you can see there is no uuid at the beginning. Any ideas if this is a bug or if the instructions are outdated?
