<https://nft.storage/terms/> claims this is limited to NFTs and not other
data. (Whatever that means; why can't I mint a NFT for a nice gpg encrypted
blob?)

I also doubt it actually will store anything for longer than the current
NFT mania; the terms have a loophole that allow them to provide 90 days
notice before ending the service.

It does have an API if someone wants to build a special remote and use it
for general data storage. But that's out of scope for this IPFS special
remote AFAICS.
