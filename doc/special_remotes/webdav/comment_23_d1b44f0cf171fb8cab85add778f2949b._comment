hey will being able to import a treeish from a webdav remote ever be supported? my use case is that i have a nextcloud instance where i store photo backups for all the smart devices in my family which all get backed up to a single shared directory.  since this tree would be ever changing due to the many smart phones connecting to it, and storing data in it, i figured a push and pull method similar to what can be done with the adb special remote could be useful to keep all the files tracked in my annex.
