When I tried running `git annex sync borg` on a large (~6T) borg repo with many archives, git-annex spun until it used 52G of memory, then got OOM-killed.

I don't know if this is a memory leak or just trying to load too much, but it seems like this is a thing you should be able to do on a machine with 64G of RAM.
