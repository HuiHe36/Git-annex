For systems (such as rsync.net) that allow us to use both rsync and git-annex, which is the better option?  I noticed that the default for rsync.net was this type (gcrypt), does it provide additional capabilities or perform slightly better than the [rsync version](https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/rsync/)?
